Puppet's command line tools consist of a single `puppet` binary with many subcommands. The following subcommands are available in this version of Puppet:

Core Tools
-----

These subcommands form the core of Puppet's tool set, and every user should understand what they do.

#{ categories[:core].reduce('') {|memo, item| memo << "- [puppet #{item}](./#{item}.html)\n"} }

Secondary subcommands
-----

Many or most users will need to use these subcommands at some point, but they aren't needed for daily use the way the core tools are.

#{ categories[:occasional].reduce('') {|memo, item| memo << "- [puppet #{item}](./#{item}.html)\n"} }

Niche subcommands
-----

Most users can ignore these subcommands. They're only useful for certain niche workflows, and most of them are interfaces to Puppet's internal subsystems.

#{ categories[:weird].reduce('') {|memo, item| memo << "- [puppet #{item}](./#{item}.html)\n"} }

EOT
        # Handle any leftovers that aren't in categories
        unless leftovers.empty?
          index_text << <<EOADDENDUM
## Puppet Enterprise-specific subcommands

Puppet Enterprise (PE) has some unique subcommands, such as `puppet infrastructure`. For reference information about these commands, use the `puppet help` command, such as `puppet help infrastructure`. For usage information, see the [Puppet Enterprise documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/).

Unknown or new subcommands
-----

These subcommands have not yet been added to any of the categories above.
