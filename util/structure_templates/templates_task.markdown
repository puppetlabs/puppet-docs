<!--Tasks describe a procedure the user performs. Tasks typically include 7 or fewer steps. Consider breaking longer tasks into a multi-task process. Avoid shoehorning conceptual or reference information into tasks so that the task is more navigable and reusable.-->

## <# TITLE -- Insert an imperative phrase that describes the task, like “Disable update checking”. #>

<# SHORTDESC -- Insert a 1-2 sentence description of the task’s purpose. #>

<# CONTEXT (optional) -- If the short description doesn’t provide enough background about the task, insert an additional paragraph to provide more context. For example, you might include information about when, where, or why users would perform the task. Don’t use this space to describe conceptual information; instead, create a separate concept topic. #>

<# PREREQ (optional) -- Insert imperative statements, preceded by "Before you begin:", describing tasks the user must complete before performing this task. For example, "Before you begin: Install Puppet Enterprise." #>
