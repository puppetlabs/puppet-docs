How to Write Documentation
==========================

The Basic Rules
---------------

### Location

Everything goes in `source/`.  Files end in `.markdown` and generate a
matching `.html` file in `output/`.

### Format

The basic format is [Markdown][1].  The output is generated by Jekyll and
[Maruku][2], which supports the features provided by [PHP Markdown Extra][3].

NOTE: Markdown + ERB is supported (`.markdown.erb`), but should not be
used unless absolutely necessary.  Contributions in this format are
tightly restricted.

### Preamble

Every document must have a preamble.  At the very least, this means a
layout and a title:

    ---
    layout: default
    title: Language Tutorial
    ---

Replace the title with the title of the document you're adding.

If you forget these, your document will not be generated.

In practice, you should aim to have your documents have a title,
summary paragraph, list of main points or accompanying references,
and the separator.  This makes a nice looking preamble section.

Something like:

    Homer Simpson
    =============

    Homer Jay Simpson is a fictional main character in the animated
    television series "The Simpsons" and father of the eponymous family.

    He has 3 children:

    * Bart
    * Lisa
    * Maggie

    * * *

    More Content

### Code

Code is indented from the left margin by four spaces, in normal
markdown style.

We support Jekyll's [Liquid Extensions for Code Highlighting][4].

The best code highlight style to use is Ruby. This presents Puppet
code in a mostly accurate highlight.

### Linking

Use absolute paths (eg, `/guides/goo/bar.html`) whenever possible;
this makes moving documents less tedious.

Footnote-style linking is preferred.

### Assets

Assets go in `files/`.  During generation, this directory is copied to
`output/files/`.

### Layout

The layout is at `source/_layouts/defaults.html`.

Beyond adding important documents to the pretty "Docs Index" box,
you shouldn't need to edit it.

Viewing Documentation
---------------------

You need to generate the content and view the `output/` directory.

At minimum, you probably need to do this:

    $ sudo rake install
    $ rake run
