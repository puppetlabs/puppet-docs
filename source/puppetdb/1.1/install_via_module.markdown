You can install any combination of PuppetDB, PostgreSQL, and the PuppetDB
terminuses for your Puppet master using the PuppetDB module from the forge:

http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb

For notes on how to use the module, take a look at the [README_GETTING_STARTED.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-puppetdb/blob/master/README_GETTING_STARTED.md)
file in the github repo.  The module also includes some sample manifests in
the `tests` that show you the basic usage.
