title: "Facter 1.7: Core Facts"
---

## Summary

This is a list of all of the built-in facts that ship with Facter 1.7.x. Not all of them apply to every system, and your site may use many [custom facts](/guides/custom_facts.html) delivered via Puppet modules. To see the actual available facts (including plugins) and their values on any of your systems, run `facter -p` at the command line. If you are using Puppet Enterprise, you can view all of the facts for any node on the node's page in the console.

Facts appear in Puppet as normal top-scope variables. This means you can access any fact for a node in your manifests with `$<fact name>`. (E.g. `$osfamily`, `$memorysize`, etc.)

## `architecture`


Returns the CPU hardware architecture.

**Resolution:**

* On OpenBSD, Linux and Debian's kfreebsd, use the hardwaremodel fact.
* Gentoo and Debian call "x86_64" "amd64".
* Gentoo also calls "i386" "x86".

* * *

## `augeasversion`


Returns the version of the Augeas library.

**Resolution:**

Loads ruby-augeas and reports the value of `/augeas/version`, the version of
the underlying Augeas library.

**Caveats:**

The library version may not indicate the presence of certain lenses,
depending on the system packages updated, nor the version of ruby-augeas
which may affect support for the Puppet Augeas provider.
Versions prior to 0.3.6 cannot be interrogated for their version.

* * *

## `blockdevice_{devicename}_size`


Returns the size of a block device in bytes.

**Resolution:**

Parse the contents of `/sys/block/{device}/size` to receive the size (multiplying by 512 to correct for blocks-to-bytes).

**Caveats:**

Only supports Linux 2.6+ at this time, due to the reliance on sysfs.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## blockdevice_{devicename}_vendor


Returns the vendor name of block devices attached to the system.

**Resolution:**

Parse the contents of `/sys/block/{device}/device/vendor` to retrieve the vendor for a device.

**Caveats:**

Only supports Linux 2.6+ at this time, due to the reliance on sysfs.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## blockdevice_{devicename}_model


Returns the model name of block devices attached to the system.

**Resolution:**

Parse the contents of `/sys/block/{device}/device/model` to retrieve the model name/number for a device.

**Caveats:**

Only supports Linux 2.6+ at this time, due to the reliance on sysfs.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## blockdevices


Returns a comma-separated list of block devices.

**Resolution:**

Retrieve the block devices that were identified and iterated over in the creation of the blockdevice_ facts.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `cfkey`


Returns the public key(s) for CFengine.

**Resolution:**

Tries each file of standard localhost.pub & cfkey.pub locations,
checks if they appear to be a public key, and then join them all together.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `domain`


Returns the host's primary DNS domain name.

**Resolution:**

* On UNIX (excluding Darwin), first try and use the hostname fact, which uses the hostname system command, and then parse the output of that.
* Failing that it tries the dnsdomainname system command.
* Failing that it uses /etc/resolv.conf and takes the domain from that, or as a final resort, the search from that.
* Otherwise returns nil.
* On Windows uses the win32ole gem and winmgmts to get the DNSDomain value from the Win32 networking stack.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `ec2_{EC2 INSTANCE DATA}`


Returns info retrieved in bulk from the EC2 API. The names of these facts should be self explanatory, and they are otherwise undocumented. The full list of these facts is:

**Caveats:**

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `fqdn`


Returns the fully qualified domain name of the host.

**Resolution:**

Simply joins the hostname fact with the domain name fact.

**Caveats:**

No attempt is made to check that the two facts are accurate or that
the two facts go together. At no point is there any DNS resolution made
either.


([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `gid`


Returns the group ID of the user running the puppet process.

**Resolution**

Uses the output of `gid -ng`.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `hardwareisa`


Returns hardware processor type.

**Resolution:**

On Solaris, Linux and the BSDs simply uses the output of "uname -p".

**Caveats:**

Some linuxes return unknown to uname -p with relative ease.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `hardwaremodel`


Returns the hardware model of the system.

**Resolution:**

* Uses purely "uname -m" on all platforms other than AIX and Windows.
* On AIX uses the parsed "modelname" output of "lsattr -El sys0 -a modelname".
* On Windows uses the 'host_cpu' pulled out of Ruby's config.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `hostname`


Returns the system's short hostname.

**Resolution:**

* On all system bar Darwin, parses the output of the "hostname" system command to everything before the first period.
* On Darwin, uses the system configuration util to get the LocalHostName variable.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `id`


Internal fact used to specify the program to return the currently running user id.

**Resolution:**

* On all Unixes bar Solaris, just returns "whoami".
* On Solaris, parses the output of the "id" command to grab the username, as Solaris doesn't have the whoami command.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `interfaces`


Returns a list of the network interfaces on the machine. These interface names are also used to construct several additional facts.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `ipaddress`


Returns the main IP address for a host.

**Resolution:**

* On the Unixes does an ifconfig, and returns the first non 127.0.0.0/8 subnetted IP it finds.
* On Windows, it attempts to use the socket library and resolve the machine's hostname via DNS.
* On LDAP based hosts it tries to use either the win32/resolv library to resolve the hostname to an IP address, or on Unix, it uses the resolv library.
* As a fall back for undefined systems, it tries to run the "host" command to resolve the machine's hostname using the system DNS.

**Caveats:**

* DNS resolution relies on working DNS infrastructure and resolvers on the host system.
* The ifconfig parsing purely takes the first IP address it finds without any checking this is a useful IP address.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `ipaddress_{NETWORK INTERFACE}`


Returns the IP4 address for a specific network interface (from the list in the `interfaces` fact).

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `ipaddress6`


Returns the "main" IPv6 IP address of a system.

**Resolution:**

OS-dependent code that parses the output of various networking tools and currently not very intelligent. Returns the first non-loopback and non-linklocal address found in the ouput unless a default route can be mapped to a routeable interface. Guessing an interface is currently only possible with BSD type systems to many assumptions have to be made on other platforms to make this work with the current code. Most code ported or modeled after the ipaddress fact for the sake of similar functionality and familiar mechanics.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `ipaddress6_{NETWORK INTERFACE}`


Returns the IP6 address for a specific network interface (from the list in the `interfaces` fact).

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

**Resolution:**

Uses either the scutil program to get the localhost name, or parses output of ifconfig for a MAC address.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `is_virtual`


Returns `true` or `false` if a machine is virtualized or not.

**Resolution:**

Hypervisors and the like may be detected as a virtual type, but are not actual virtual machines, or should not be treated as such. This determines if the host is actually virtualized.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `kernel`


Returns the operating system's name.

**Resolution:**

Uses Ruby's rbconfig to find `host_os`, if that is a Windows derivative, the returns 'windows', otherwise returns "uname -s" verbatim.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `kernelmajversion`


Returns the operating system's release number's major value.

**Resolution:**

Takes the first 2 elements of the kernel version as delimited by periods.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `kernelrelease`


Returns the operating system's release number.

**Resolution:**

* On AIX returns the output from the "oslevel -s" system command.
* On Windows based systems, uses the win32ole gem to query Windows Management for the '`Win32_OperatingSystem`' value.
* Otherwise uses the output of "uname -r" system command.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `kernelversion`


Returns the operating system's kernel version.

**Resolution:**

* On Solaris and SunOS based machines, returns the output of "uname -v".

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `lsbminordistrelease`


Returns the minor version of the operation system version as gleaned from the lsbdistrelease fact.

**Resolution:**

Parses the lsbdistrelease fact for numbers preceded by a period and returns those. If there is no match, the fact is not present.

**Caveats:**

If the version number has three components (e.g., '1.2.3'), only the second will be included in the fact.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

Parses the output of `dmidecode`.

**Caveats:**

Only available on some versions of Linux, including RHEL/CentOS.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))

* * *

## `virtual`


Determine if the system's hardware is real or virtualized.

**Resolution:**

Assumes physical unless proven otherwise.

* On Darwin, uses the macosx util module to acquire the SPDisplaysDataType and from that parses it to see if it's VMWare or Parallels pretending to be the display.
* On Linux, BSD, Solaris, and HPUX: Much of the logic here is obscured behind util/virtual.rb, which rather than document here, which would encourage drift, just refer to it. The Xen tests in here rely on `/sys` and `/proc`, and check for the presence and contents of files in there. If after all the other tests it's still seen as physical, then it tries to parse the output of `lspci`, `dmidecode` and `prtdiag` for obvious signs of being under VMWare, Parallels, or VirtualBox. Finally, it checks for the existence of vmware-vmx, which would hint it's VMWare.

**Caveats:**

Many checks rely purely on existence of files.

([↑ Back to top](#page-nav))
