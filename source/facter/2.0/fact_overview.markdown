Overview of Facts in Facter
===========================

## What is a fact?

Facter examines the system it's running on and returns what it finds as a set of **facts**. You can get the set of facts for a system by running `facter` at the command line, but it's most useful as an integrated part of Puppet. Within Puppet, facts are [top-scope](/puppet/3/reference/lang_scope.html#top-scope) variables that hold information about the puppet agent. For example, if the puppet agent node is a virtual machine running CentOS 6.4, the following facts (among many others) will be available:

  * $::operatingsystem = "CentOS"
  * $::operatingsystemrelease = "6.4"
  * $::osfamily = "redhat"
  * $::is_virtual = "true"

Facts are always strings. That includes facts like `$operatingsystemrelease` and `$is_virtual`, which look like other data types (float and boolean, respectively). If you want to do, say, numerical comparison or boolean logic using facts, you'll have to take additional steps to convert them first. Facter comes with a number of built-in **core facts**, but you can also write your own [custom facts](custom_facts.html).


## Flat and Structured Facts

There are two major categories of facts: flat and structured. **Flat facts** are those that return a single string corresponding to one piece of data, like all of the examples above. All facts were flat prior to Facter 2, and most core facts still are. You can refer to them in puppet manifests just like any other string variable:

{% highlight ruby %}

				# Interpolating flat facts
				notify { "This agent node is running $::operatingsystem version $::operatingsystemrelease": }

{% endhighlight %}

Flat facts are great when you have a neat one-to-one mapping between facts and strings, but they're not ideal for examining parts of the system that may have multiple parts. The classic example for this is IP addresses, since a node could have several of them. Earlier versions of Facter generated individual facts with unique suffixes for cases like this, but Facter 2 introduced **structured facts**. Now, all IP addresses are stored in a single fact that's structured like a whatnow?:


## Examples

### Facts in Puppet

{% highlight ruby %}

    # Facts are always strings
    case $::is_virtual {
     true: { notice "This will never be evaluated because it attempts to match a fact to a boolean." }
     "true": { notice "But this could be, since we're matching 'true' as a string." }
    }

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}

    # Pulling out part of a structured fact
    # No idea how to do this yet

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}

    # Iterating through a structured fact
    # No idea how to do this yet

{% endhighlight %}
### Facter on the Command Line

It's not the most common way to use Facter, but the `facter` command-line tool is very useful for quickly checking what the value of a fact is on a particular system. If you run it without any arguments, you'll get a listing of every available fact and its value:

    root@master$ facter
    architecture => x86_64
    augeasversion => 1.1.0
    bios_release_date => 12/01/2006
    bios_vendor => innotek GmbH
    bios_version => VirtualBox
    ...
    virtual => virtualbox

If you pass facter the name of a fact, it will return only the value for that fact. If the fact is not available on the system, facter will exit silently:

    root@master$ facter not_a_real_fact
    root@master$ facter is_virtual
    true

You can get more usage information by running `facter --help`.
