Facter is Puppet's cross-platform system profiling library. It discovers and reports per-node facts, which are available in your Puppet manifests as variables.

The currently supported Facter versions are 2.x and 1.7. Both versions work with Puppet 3.x and 2.7.

* [The Facter release notes](/facter/latest/release_notes.html) lists the new features and fixes in the latest Facter version.
* [The list of core facts](/facter/latest/core_facts.html) lists and describes every built-in fact that ships with Facter.
* [The custom facts overview](/facter/latest/fact_overview.html) is an example-driven primer and reference for fact authors.
* [The custom facts walkthrough](/facter/latest/custom_facts.html) explains how to write and distribute your own facts in detail.
