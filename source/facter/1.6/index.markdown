Facter is Puppet's cross-platform system profiling library. It discovers and reports per-node facts, which are available in your Puppet manifests as variables.

* [The list of core facts](/facter/1.6/core_facts.html) lists and describes every built-in fact that ships with Facter.
* [The custom facts guide](/guides/custom_facts.html) explains how to write and distribute your own facts.
* [The Facter release notes](/facter/1.6/core_facts.html) document Facter's history.
