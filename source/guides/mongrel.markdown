Using Mongrel
=============

Puppet daemons default to using WEBrick for http serving, but puppetmasterd can be used with Mongrel instead for performance

The mongrel documentation is currently maintained our [our Wiki](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Using_Mongrel) until it can be migrated over.  Please see the OS specific setup documents on the Wiki for further information.
