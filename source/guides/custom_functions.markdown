Custom Functions
================

Extend the Puppet interpreter by writing your own custom functions.

* * *

## Writing your own functions

The Puppet language and interpreter is very extensible. One of the
places you can extend Puppet is in creating new functions to be
executed on the puppet master at the time
that the manifest is compiled. To give you an idea of what you can
do with these functions, the built-in template and include
functions are implemented in exactly the same way as the functions
you're learning to write here.

Custom functions are written in Ruby, so you'll need a working
understanding of the language before you begin.

### Gotchas

There are a few things that can trip you up when you're writing
your functions:

-   Your function will be executed on the server. This means that
    any files or other resources you reference must be available on the
    server, and you can't do anything that requires direct access to
    the client machine.
-   There are actually two completely different types of functions
    available --- *rvalues* (which return a value) and *statements*
    (which do not). If you are writing an rvalue function, you must pass
    `:type => :rvalue` when creating the function; see the examples below.
-   The name of the file containing your function must be the
    same as the name of function; otherwise it won't get automatically
    loaded.
-   To use a *fact* about a client, use `lookupvar('{fact name}')`
    instead of `Facter['{fact name}'].value`.  If the *fact* does not
    exist, `lookupvar` returns `:undefined`. See examples below.

### Where to put your functions

Functions are implemented in individual .rb files (whose filenames must match the names of their respective functions), and should be distributed in modules. Put custom functions in the lib/puppet/parser/functions subdirectory of your module; see [Plugins in Modules](./plugins_in_modules.html) for additional details (including compatibility with versions of Puppet prior to 0.25.0).

If you are using a version of Puppet prior to 0.24.0, or have some other compelling reason to not use [plugins in modules](./plugins_in_modules.html), functions can also be loaded from .rb files in the following locations:

-   `$libdir/puppet/parser/functions`
-   `puppet/parser/functions` sub-directories in your Ruby `$LOAD_PATH`

## First Function --- small steps

New functions are defined by executing the `newfunction` method
inside the `Puppet::Parser::Functions` module. You pass the name of
the function as a symbol to `newfunction`, and the code to be run as
a block. So a trivial function to write a string to a file in /tmp
might look like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
    module Puppet::Parser::Functions
      newfunction(:write_line_to_file) do |args|
        filename = args[0]
        str = args[1]
        File.open(filename, 'a') {|fd| fd.puts str }
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

To use this function, it's as simple as using it in your manifest:

{% highlight ruby %}
    write_line_to_file('/tmp/some_file', "Hello world!")
{% endhighlight %}

(Note that this is not a useful function by any stretch of the imagination.)

The arguments to the function are passed into the block via the
`args` argument to the block. This is simply an array of all of the
arguments given in the manifest when the function is called.
There's no real parameter validation, so you'll need to do that
yourself.

This simple `write_line_to_file` function is an example of a
*statement* function. It performs an action, and does not return a
value. The other type of function
is an *rvalue* function, which you must use in a context which
requires a value, such as an `if` statement, a `case` statement, or a
variable or attribute assignment. You could implement a `rand`
function like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
    module Puppet::Parser::Functions
      newfunction(:rand, :type => :rvalue) do |args|
        rand(vals.empty? ? 0 : args[0])
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

This function works identically to the Ruby built-in rand function.
Randomising things isn't quite as useful as you might think,
though. The first use for a `rand` function that springs to mind is
probably to vary the minute of a cron job. For instance, to stop
all your machines from running a job at the same time, you might do
something like:

{% highlight ruby %}
    cron { run_some_job_at_a_random_time:
      command => "/usr/local/sbin/some_job",
      minute => rand(60)
    }
{% endhighlight %}

But the problem here is quite simple: every time the Puppet client
runs, the rand function gets re-evaluated, and your cron job moves
around. The moral: just because a function *seems* like a good
idea, don't be so quick to assume that it'll be the answer to all
your problems.

## Using Facts and Variables

Which raises the question: what _should_ you do if you want to splay
your cron jobs on different machines?
The trick is to tie the minute value to something that's invariant
in time, but different across machines. Perhaps the MD5
hash of the hostname, modulo 60, or maybe the IP address of the
host converted to an integer, modulo 60. Neither
guarantees uniqueness, but you can't really expect that with a range
of no more than 60 anyway.

But given that functions are run on the puppet master, how do you get at
the hostname or IP address of the agent node?
The answer is that facts returned by facter can be used in our
functions.

### Example 1

{% highlight ruby %}
    require 'ipaddr'

    module Puppet::Parser::Functions
      newfunction(:minute_from_address, :type => :rvalue) do |args|
        IPAddr.new(lookupvar('ipaddress')).to_i % 60
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

### Example 2

{% highlight ruby %}
    require 'md5'

    module Puppet::Parser::Functions
      newfunction(:hour_from_fqdn, :type => :rvalue) do |args|
        MD5.new(lookupvar('fqdn')).to_s.hex % 24
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

### Example 3

{% highlight ruby %}
    module Puppet::Parser::Functions
      newfunction(:has_fact, :type => :rvalue) do |arg|
        lookupvar(arg[0]) != :undefined
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

Basically, to get a fact's or variable's value, you just call
`lookupvar('{fact name}')`.

## Calling Functions from Functions

Functions can be accessed from other functions by 
calling `Puppet::Parser::Functions.autoloader.loadall` at the beginning of your new function, then prepending `function_` to the name of the function you are trying to call.  Alternatively, you can load a specific function by calling `Puppet::Parser::Functions.function('myfunc1')`

Also keep in mind that when calling a puppet function from the puppet DSL, arguments are all passed in as an anonymous array.  This is not the case when calling the function from within Ruby.  To work around this, you must create the anonymous array yourself by putting the arguments (even if there is only one argument) inside square brackets like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
    [ arg1, arg1, arg3 ]
{% endhighlight %}

### Example

{% highlight ruby %}
    module Puppet::Parser::Functions
      newfunction(:myfunc2, :type => :rvalue) do |args|
        Puppet::Parser::Functions.autoloader.loadall
        function_myfunc1( [ arg1, arg2, ... ] )
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

## Handling Errors

To throw a parse/compile error in your function, in a similar
manner to the `fail()` function:

{% highlight ruby %}
    raise Puppet::ParseError, "my error"
{% endhighlight %}

## Troubleshooting Functions

If you're experiencing problems with your functions loading,
there's a couple of things you can do to see what might be causing
the issue:

1 - Make sure your function is parsing correctly, by running:

    ruby -rpuppet my_funct.rb

This should return nothing if the function is parsing correctly,
otherwise you'll get an exception which should help troubleshoot
the problem.

2 - Check that the function is available to Puppet:

    irb
    > require 'puppet'
    > require '/path/to/puppet/functions/my_funct.rb'
    > Puppet::Parser::Functions.function(:my_funct)
    => "function_my_funct"

Substitute `:my_funct` with the name of your function, and it should
return something similar to "`function_my_funct`" if the function
is seen by Puppet. Otherwise it will just return false, indicating
that you still have a problem (and you'll more than likely get a
"Unknown Function" error on your clients).

## Referencing Custom Functions In Templates

To call a custom function within a [Puppet Template](./templating.html), you can do:

    <%= scope.function_namegoeshere(["one","two"]) %>

Replace "namegoeshere" with the function name, and even if there is only one argument, still
include the array brackets.

## Notes on Backward Compatibility

### Accessing Files With Older Versions of Puppet

In Puppet 2.6.0 and later, functions can access files with the expectation that
it will just work. In versions prior to 2.6.0, functions that accessed files
had to explicitly warn the parser to recompile the configuration if the files
they relied on changed.

If you find yourself needing to write custom functions for older versions of Puppet, the relevant instructions are preserved below.

#### Accessing Files in Puppet 0.23.2 through 0.24.9

Until Puppet 0.25.0, safe file access was achieved by adding `self.interp.newfile($filename)` to the function. E.g., to accept a file name and return the last line of that file:

{% highlight ruby %}
    module Puppet::Parser::Functions
      newfunction(:file_last_line, :type => :rvalue) do |args|
        self.interp.newfile(args[0])
        lines = IO.readlines(args[0])
        lines[lines.length - 1]
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

#### Accessing Files in Puppet 0.25.x

In release 0.25.0, the necessary code changed to:

{% highlight ruby %}
    parser = Puppet::Parser::Parser.new(environment)
    parser.watch_file($filename)
{% endhighlight %}

This new code was used identically to the older code:

{% highlight ruby %}
    module Puppet::Parser::Functions
      newfunction(:file_last_line, :type => :rvalue) do |args|
        parser = Puppet::Parser::Parser.new(environment)
        parser.watch_file($filename)
        lines = IO.readlines(args[0])
        lines[lines.length - 1]
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}
