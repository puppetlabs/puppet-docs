Puppet requires [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Certain versions of Ruby work better with Puppet than others.

* Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.8.5 are fully supported with Puppet 2.6 and 2.7, and Puppet Labs runs automated tests on both of these versions.
* Ruby 1.9.2 and higher are supported with Puppet 2.7, and Puppet Labs runs automated tests on version 1.9.2. 
* Ruby 1.8.1 is partially supported for agent-only use on a best-effort basis, and is not included in our automated testing. 
* Ruby 1.8.6, 1.9.0, and 1.9.1 have significant compatibility issues with Puppet, and there are no plans to make Puppet work with these versions.
* Puppet Enterprise has no Ruby version requirement, as it manages its own Ruby environment.

Please [contact Puppet Labs](http://puppetlabs.com/contact/) if you are interested in a platform not on this list.
