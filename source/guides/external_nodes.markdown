External Node Classifiers
==============

An external node classifier is an arbitrary script or application which can tell Puppet which classes a node should have. It can replace or work in concert with the `node` definitions in the main site manifest (`site.pp`).

Depending on the external data sources you use in your infrastructure, building an external node classifier can be a valuable way to extend Puppet.

* * *

What Is an ENC?
---------------

An external node classifier is an executable that can be called by puppet master; it doesn't have to be written in Ruby. Its only argument is the name of the node to be classified, and it returns a YAML document describing the node.

Inside the ENC, you can reference any data source you want, including some of Puppet's own data sources, but from Puppet's perspective, it just puts in a node name and gets back a hash of information.

ENCs can co-exist with standard node definitions in `site.pp`, and **the classes declared in each source are effectively merged.**

> ### How Merging Works
>
> Every node **always** gets a **node object** (which may be empty or may contain classes, parameters, and an environment) from the configured `node_terminus`. (This setting takes effect where the catalog is compiled; on the puppet master server when using an agent/master arrangement, and on the node itself when using puppet apply. The default node terminus is `plain`, which returns an empty node object; the `exec` terminus calls an ENC script to determine what should go in the node object.) Every node **may** also get a **node definition** from the site manifest (usually called site.pp).
>
> When compiling a node's catalog, Puppet will include **all** of the following:
>
> * Any classes specified in the node object it received from the node terminus
> * Any classes or resources which are in the site manifest but outside any node definitions
> * Any classes or resources in the most specific node definition in site.pp that matches the current node (if site.pp contains any node definitions)
>     * Note 1: If site.pp contains at least one node definition, it **must** have a node definition that matches the current node; compilation will fail if a match can't be found.
>     * Note 2: If the node name resembles a dot-separated fully qualified domain name, Puppet will make multiple attempts to match a node definition, removing the right-most part of the name each time. Thus, Puppet would first try `agent1.example.com`, then `agent1.example`, then `agent1`. This behavior isn't mimicked when calling an ENC, which is invoked only once with the agent's full node name.
>     * Note 3: If no matching node definition can be found with the node's name, Puppet will try one last time with a node name of `default`; most users include a `node default {}` statement in their site.pp file. This behavior isn't mimicked when calling an ENC.


Considerations and Differences from Node Definitions
-----

[above]: #considerations-and-differences-from-node-definitions

* The YAML returned by an ENC isn't an exact equivalent of a node definition in `site.pp` --- it can't declare individual resources, declare relationships, or do conditional logic. The only things an ENC can do are **declare classes, assign top-scope variables, and set an environment.** This means an ENC is most effective if you've done a good job of separating your configurations out into classes and modules.
* In Puppet 3 and later, ENCs can set an [environment][] for a node,  overriding whatever environment the node requested. However, previous versions of Puppet use ENC-set and node-set environments inconsistently, with the ENC's used during catalog compilation and the node's used when downloading files. The workaround for Puppet 2.7 and earlier is to use Puppet to manage `puppet.conf` on the agent and set the environment for the next run based on what the ENC thinks it should be.
* Even if you aren't using node definitions, you can still use site.pp to do things like set global resource defaults.
* Unlike regular node definitions, where a node may match a less specific definition if an exactly matching one isn't found (depending on the puppet master's `strict_hostname_checking` setting), an ENC is called only once, with the node's full name.


Connecting an ENC
-----------------

To tell puppet master to use an ENC, you need to set two [configuration](./configuring.html) options: `node_terminus` has to be set to "exec", and `external_nodes` should have the path to the executable.

    [master]
      node_terminus = exec
      external_nodes = /usr/local/bin/puppet_node_classifier


ENC Output Format
-----------------

ENCs must return either a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org) hash or nothing. This hash may contain `classes`, `parameters`, and `environment` keys, and must contain at least either `classes` or `parameters`. ENCs should exit with an exit code of 0 when functioning normally, and may exit with a non-zero exit code if you wish puppet master to behave as though the requested node was not found.

If an ENC returns nothing or exits with a non-zero exit code, the catalog compilation will fail with a "could not find node" error, and the node will be unable to retrieve configurations.

#### Classes

If present, the value of `classes` must be either an array of class names or a hash whose keys are class names. That is, the following are equivalent:

    classes:
      - common
      - puppet
      - dns
      - ntp

    classes:
      common:
      puppet:
      dns:
      ntp:

Parameterized classes cannot be used with the array syntax. When using the hash key syntax, the value for a parameterized class should be a hash of the class's attributes and values. Each value may be a string, number, array, or hash. String values should be quoted, as unquoted strings like "on" may be interpreted as booleans. Non-parameterized classes may have empty values.

    classes:
        common:
        puppet:
        ntp:
            ntpserver: 0.pool.ntp.org
        aptsetup:
            additional_apt_repos:
                - deb localrepo.example.com/ubuntu lucid production
                - deb localrepo.example.com/ubuntu lucid vendor

#### Parameters

If present, the value of the `parameters` key must be a hash of valid variable names and associated values; these will be exposed to the compiler as top scope variables. Each value may be a string, number, array, or hash.

    parameters:
        ntp_servers:
            - 0.pool.ntp.org
            - ntp.example.com
        mail_server: mail.example.com
        iburst: true


#### Environment

If present, the value of `environment` must be a string representing the desired [environment][] for this node. In Puppet 3 and later, this will become the only environment used by the node in its requests for catalogs and files. In Puppet 2.7 ENC-set environments are not reliable, [as noted above.][above]

    environment: production

Tricks, Notes, and Further Reading
----------------------------------

* Although only the node name is directly passed to an ENC, it can make decisions based on other facts about the node by querying the [inventory service](./inventory_service.html) HTTP API or using the puppet facts subcommand shipped with Puppet 2.7.
* Puppet's "exec" `node_terminus` is just one way for Puppet to build node objects, and it's optimized for flexibility and for the simplicity of its API. There are situations where it can make more sense to design a native node terminus instead of an ENC, one example being the "ldap" node terminus that ships with Puppet. See [the LDAP nodes documentation on the wiki](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/LDAP_Nodes) for more info.
