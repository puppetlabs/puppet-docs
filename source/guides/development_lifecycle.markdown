# Contributing to Puppet Labs Projects (Puppet, Dashboard, Facter and more)

So you want to contribute to a Puppet Labs project? Awesome!

We would like to make contributing as easy as possible since your contributions are greatly appreciated.

That said, there are a few guidelines that make reviewing and applying contributions easier.  We hope that the information below will answer any questions you might have about helping out with the Puppet Labs projects.

If you have any questions about contributing to a Puppet Labs project that aren't answered here, the [Getting Help](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Getting_Help) page has a list of additional resources for finding those answers.

# Steps

Check the `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root of the project tree:

  * [Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  * [Facter](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  * [Puppet Dashboard](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-dashboard/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

These should all be the same, but there may be some project specific notes in each.  If the project you wish to contribute to does not have a `CONTRIBUTING.md`, then you should follow the one from the Puppet repository.
