Puppet Labs maintains official package repositories for several of the more popular Linux distributions. These repos contain the latest available packages for Puppet, Facter, PuppetDB, MCollective, and several prerequisites and add-ons for Puppet Labs products.

We also maintain repositories for Puppet Enterprise 2.8.x users. These repos contain additional PE components, as well as modified packages for tools like PuppetDB which will integrate more smoothly with PE's namespaced installation layout. Note these *only* apply to users of PE 2.8. In PE 3.x, PuppetDB and other components are already integrated.

This page explains how to enable these repositories on all of the supported operating systems.

Our repositories will be maintained for the life of the corresponding operating system and available for three months after their end of life date. So if an operating system goes end of life on July 15, our repositories for that operating system will still be available until October 15.

Enabling the Prerelease Repos
