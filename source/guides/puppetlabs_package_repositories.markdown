Puppet Labs maintains official package repositories for several of the more popular Linux distributions. These repos contain the latest available packages for Puppet, Facter, PuppetDB, Puppet Dashboard, MCollective, and several prerequisites and add-ons for Puppet Labs products.

We also maintain repositories for Puppet Enterprise users. These repos contain additional PE components, as well as modified packages for tools like PuppetDB which will integrate more smoothly with PE's namespaced installation layout.

This page explains how to enable these repositories on all of the supported operating systems.

Open Source Repositories
-----

Use these repositories to install open source releases of Puppet, Facter, MCollective, PuppetDB, and more. After enabling the repo, [follow the instructions for installing Puppet](./installation.html).

### For Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Derivatives

The [yum.puppetlabs.com](http://yum.puppetlabs.com) repository supports versions 5 and 6 of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and distributions based on it, including but not limited to CentOS, Scientific Linux, and Ascendos. Enabling this repository will let you install Puppet without requiring any other external repositories like EPEL.

To enable the repository, run the command below that corresponds to your OS version:

#### Enterprise Linux 5

    $ sudo rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/el/5/products/i386/puppetlabs-release-5-7.noarch.rpm

#### Enterprise Linux 6

    $ sudo rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/el/6/products/i386/puppetlabs-release-6-7.noarch.rpm

### For Debian and Ubuntu

The [apt.puppetlabs.com](http://apt.puppetlabs.com) repository supports the following OS versions:

* Debian 6 "Squeeze" (current stable release) (also supported by [Puppet Enterprise][peinstall])
* Debian "Wheezy" (current testing distribution)
* Debian "Sid" (current unstable distribution)
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS "Precise Pangolin" (also supported by [Puppet Enterprise][peinstall])
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS "Lucid Lynx" (also supported by [Puppet Enterprise][peinstall])
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS "Hardy Heron"
* Ubuntu 12.10 "Quantal Quetzal"
* Ubuntu 11.10 "Oneiric Ocelot"

To enable the repository:

1. Download the "puppetlabs-release" package for your OS version.
    * You can see a full list of these packages on the front page of <http://apt.puppetlabs.com/>. They are all named `puppetlabs-release-<CODE NAME>.deb`.
2. Install the package by running `dpkg -i <PACKAGE NAME>`.

For example, to enable the repository for Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin:

    $ wget http://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-precise.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-precise.deb
    $ sudo apt-get update

### For Fedora

The [yum.puppetlabs.com](http://yum.puppetlabs.com) repository supports Fedora 16, 17 and 18. To enable the repository, run the command below that corresponds to your OS version:

#### Fedora 16

    $ sudo rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/fedora/f16/products/i386/puppetlabs-release-16-7.noarch.rpm

#### Fedora 17

    $ sudo rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/fedora/f17/products/i386/puppetlabs-release-17-7.noarch.rpm

#### Fedora 18

    $ sudo rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/fedora/f18/products/i386/puppetlabs-release-18-7.noarch.rpm

Enabling the Prerelease Repos
-----

Our open source repository packages also install a disabled prerelease repo, which contains release candidate versions of all Puppet Labs products. Enable this if you wish to test upcoming versions early, or if you urgently need a bug fix that has not gone into a final release yet.

### On Debian and Ubuntu

After installing the repos, open your `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/puppetlabs.list` file for editing. Locate and uncomment the line that begins with `deb` and ends with `devel`:

    # Puppetlabs devel (uncomment to activate)
    deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com precise devel
    # deb-src http://apt.puppetlabs.com precise devel

To disable the prerelease repo, re-comment the line.

### On Fedora, RHEL, and Derivatives

After installing the repos, open your `/etc/yum.repos.d/puppetlabs.repo` file for editing. Locate the `[puppetlabs-devel]` stanza, and change the value of the `enabled` key from `0` to `1`:

    [puppetlabs-devel]
    name=Puppet Labs Devel <%= @dist.capitalize -%> <%= @version -%> - $basearch
    baseurl=http://yum.puppetlabs.com/<%= @dist.downcase -%>/<%= @codename -%>/devel/$basearch
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-puppetlabs
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1

To disable the prerelease repo, change the value back to `0`.
