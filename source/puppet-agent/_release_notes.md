### Release Notes

* **1.2.6**, Oct. 12, 2015: Contains no component fixes or updates. It only resolves a packaging issue that could leave the `puppet` and `mcollective` services stopped and unregistered after a package upgrade from an earlier `puppet-agent` release.
* **1.2.5**, Oct. 1, 2015: Updates [MCollective](/mcollective/releasenotes.html#changes-since-284) to fix an issue when trying to start `mcollectived` on Solaris 10. It also changes the package file names on OS X to use major and minor OS versions (such as `puppet-agent-1.2.5-1.osx10.10.dmg`) instead of codenames (such as `puppet-agent-1.2.5-1.yosemite.dmg`).
* **1.2.4**, Sept. 14, 2015: Updates [Puppet](/puppet/4.2/reference/release_notes.html#puppet-422), [Facter](/facter/3.1/release_notes.html#facter-310), and [MCollective](/mcollective/releasenotes.html#changes-since-283).
* **1.2.3**: _Not released._
* **1.2.2**, July 22, 2015: Resolved bugs in [Facter](/facter/3.0/release_notes.html#facter-302) and [Puppet](/puppet/4.2/reference/release_notes.html#puppet-421).
