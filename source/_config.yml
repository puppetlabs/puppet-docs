#Anatomy of an external source:
#  mcollective: # an arbitrary name. The working dir for this source will be at externalsources/<name>.
#    url: /mcollective # The absolute URL where the source's contents should be mounted in the final site.
#    repo: git://github.com/puppetlabs/marionette-collective.git # The URL of the upstream repo, in a form acceptable to `git clone`. This must be accessible to anyone who will need to deploy the site.
#    commit: origin/master # a git treeish (in a form acceptable to `git checkout`) that the external source should track. This should almost always be either a tag, which will never update, or an upstream tracking branch on the default "origin" remote (origin/<branch>), which will update every time someone builds the site.
#    subdirectory: website # A subdirectory within the remote repository that contains the documentation files that we'll build and mount at the specified url.
externalsources:
  # Older versions of PuppetDB are now 'legacy' and so we can clear the branch, we are
  # referencing a tag instead.
