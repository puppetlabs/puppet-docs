We publish official packages and run automated testing on the following versions:

* Enterprise Linux 5 (also supported by [Puppet Enterprise][el_peinstall])
* Enterprise Linux 6 (also supported by [Puppet Enterprise][el_peinstall])
* Enterprise Linux 7 (also supported by [Puppet Enterprise][el_peinstall])

Puppet Enterprise also supports RHEL 4, which does not receive packages for open source Puppet.

(Note that RHEL 5 requires an [updated Ruby ≥ 1.8.7 from our yum repo.](/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html))

This information applies to RHEL itself, as well as any distributions that maintain binary compatibility with it, including but not limited to CentOS, Scientific Linux, Oracle Linux, and Ascendos.
