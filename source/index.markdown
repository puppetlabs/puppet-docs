Welcome to the Puppet Labs documentation site. The documentation posted here is also available as a set of PDFs, which can be found [here](http://info.puppetlabs.com/download-pdfs.html). You can also [download the current version of this entire website](./puppetdocs-latest.tar.gz) as a zipped archive; unzip it and follow the instructions in the README.txt file to view the site offline.

[Puppet](/puppet)
-----

Puppet manages your servers: you describe machine configurations in an easy-to-read declarative language, and Puppet will bring your systems into the desired state and keep them there.

[See the index for Puppet's documentation here](/puppet), or go directly to one of the most popular pages:

- [The Learning Puppet series](/learning) is a guided tutorial for new users, which includes a free VM to run exercises on and experiment with. Go from "What's that?" to "I can do it" in just a few hours.
- [The installation guide](/guides/installation.html) can help you install and configure the current open-source Puppet releases.
- [The Puppet 3.5 Reference Manual](/puppet/3.5/reference), and the older [Puppet 3 Manual](/puppet/3/reference) covering Puppet 3.0-3.4.
- [The Puppet 2.7 Reference Manual](/puppet/2.7/reference)
- [The latest type reference](/references/latest/type.html) covers all of the built-in resource types and their available attributes. New users should start elsewhere, but experienced users will spend most of their time in this one page.
- [The glossary](/references/glossary.html) explains the terminology you'll encounter when reading about Puppet.


[Puppet Enterprise](/pe/latest)
-----

Puppet Enterprise is a complete configuration management platform, with an optimized set of components proven to work well together. It combines Puppet (including a preconfigured production-grade puppet master stack), a web console for analyzing reports and controlling your infrastructure, powerful orchestration features, cloud provisioning tools, and professional support.

Nearly all of the main Puppet and MCollective documentation also applies to Puppet Enterprise. For details about PE's configuration:

- [Puppet Enterprise user's guide](/pe/latest/)
- [The system requirements](/pe/latest/install_system_requirements.html)
- [The installation instructions](/pe/latest/install_basic.html) or [the upgrade instructions](/pe/latest/install_upgrading.html)
- [The quick start guide](/pe/latest/quick_start.html), which walks through building and managing a small proof-of-concept deployment.
- [The deployment guide](./guides/deployment_guide/index.html) has a ton of information to help you set up and deploy Puppet Enterprise in accordance with the best practices and methods used by Puppet Labs' professional services engineers.
- [The PE download page](http://info.puppetlabs.com/download-pe.html)

The current version of PE is 3.2. Documentation for previous versions can be found [here](/pe/index.html).

[MCollective](/mcollective)
-----

MCollective is a powerful orchestration framework. Run actions on thousands of servers simultaneously, using existing plugins or writing your own.

[See the MCollective docs index](/mcollective/), or go directly to:

- [The Vagrant-based demo environment](/mcollective/deploy/demo.html), to try MCollective immediately
- [The standard deployment guide](/mcollective/deploy/standard.html), to deploy MCollective into your production environment with the recommended configurations
- [The overview of components](/mcollective/overview_components.html), to learn about the server, client, and middleware roles
- [The guide to writing new agent plugins](/mcollective/simplerpc/), to build powerful actions that solve your specific problems
- [The release notes](/mcollective/releasenotes.html)

> Note: MCollective is included with Puppet Enterprise.

[Puppet Dashboard](/dashboard/manual/1.2)
-----

Puppet Dashboard is an open source web console for Puppet, which can analyze reports, browse inventory data, and assign classes to nodes.

[See the Dashboard 1.2 manual](/dashboard/manual/1.2), or go directly to:

* [The installation instructions](/dashboard/manual/1.2/bootstrapping.html)
* [The configuration guide](/dashboard/manual/1.2/configuring.html)
* [The maintenance guide](/dashboard/manual/1.2/maintaining.html)

> Note: Puppet Enterprise's console is based on Puppet Dashboard, and extends it with extra features. PE users should see the PE documentation instead of the Dashboard documentation.

[PuppetDB](/puppetdb/latest)
-----

PuppetDB is the fast, scalable, and reliable data warehouse for Puppet. It caches data generated by Puppet, and gives you advanced features at awesome speed with a powerful API.

[See the manual for the latest version of PuppetDB](/puppetdb/latest), or go directly to:

* [Install via Puppet Module](/puppetdb/latest/install_via_module.html)
* [Install Manually](/puppetdb/latest/install_from_packages.html)
* [System requirements](/puppetdb/latest/index.html#system-requirements)
* [Troubleshooting FAQ](/puppetdb/latest/puppetdb-faq.html)

Documentation for other versions of PuppetDB can be found [here](/puppetdb).

[Hiera](/hiera/1)
-----

Hiera is a key/value lookup tool for configuration data, built to make Puppet better and let you set node-specific data without repeating yourself. Hiera support is built into Puppet 3, and is available as an add-on for Puppet 2.7.

[See the Hiera 1 manual](/hiera/1), or go directly to:

* [The installation instructions](/hiera/1/installing.html)
* [The config file reference](/hiera/1/configuring.html)
* [Info about hierarchies](/hiera/1/hierarchy.html)
* [How to write data sources](/hiera/1/data_sources.html)
* [Using Hiera with Puppet](/hiera/1/puppet.html)
* [Using Hiera from the command line](/hiera/1/command_line.html)


[Facter](/facter/latest/core_facts.html)
-----

Facter is Puppet's cross-platform system profiling library. It discovers and reports per-node facts, which are available in your Puppet manifests as variables.

* [The list of core facts](/facter/latest/core_facts.html) lists and describes every built-in fact that ships with Facter.
* [The custom fact overview](/facter/latest/fact_overview.html) is an example-driven primer and reference for fact authors.
* [The custom facts guide](/guides/custom_facts.html) explains how to write and distribute your own facts in detail.


[Geppetto](/geppetto/latest/index.html)
-----

Geppetto is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Puppet. It provides a toolset for developing puppet modules and manifests that includes syntax highlighting, error tracing/debugging, and code completion features. Geppetto also adds PE integration by parsing PuppetDB error reporting. This allows you to quickly find the problems with your puppet code that are causing configuration failures.

* [The Geppetto Manual](/geppetto/latest/index.html) has installation and usage instructions.

Documentation Version
---------------------

This release of the documentation was generated from revision {% gitrevision %} of the [puppet-docs Git repo](http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs) on {{ 'now' | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}.
<!-- This used to be hardcoded as the sha of "master", since shenanigans with the "release" branch made HEAD unreliable. But now we can accurately call out the source version even when generating from a topic branch. -->
