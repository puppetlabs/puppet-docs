<h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This command uses the cached catalog from the previous run of 'puppet
agent' to determine which attributes of which resources have been
marked as auditable with the 'audit' metaparameter. It then examines
the current state of the system, writes the state of the specified
resource attributes to a report, and submits the report to the puppet
master.</p>

<p>Puppet inspect does not run as a daemon, and must be run manually or
from cron.</p>

also a valid long argument, e.g. '--server=master.domain.com'. See the
configuration file documentation at

the full list of acceptable settings.</p>
