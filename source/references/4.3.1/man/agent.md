  <code>puppet-agent</code> - <span class="man-whatis">The puppet agent daemon</span>
</p>

<h2 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<p>Retrieves the client configuration from the puppet master and applies it to
the local host.</p>

<p>This service may be run as a daemon, run periodically using cron (or something
similar), or run interactively for testing purposes.</p>

<h2 id="USAGE">USAGE</h2>

<p>puppet agent [--certname <var>NAME</var>] [-D|--daemonize|--no-daemonize]
  [-d|--debug] [--detailed-exitcodes] [--digest <var>DIGEST</var>] [--disable [MESSAGE]] [--enable]
  [--fingerprint] [-h|--help] [-l|--logdest syslog|eventlog|<var>FILE</var>|console]

  [-v|--verbose] [-V|--version] [-w|--waitforcert <var>SECONDS</var>]</p>

<h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This is the main puppet client. Its job is to retrieve the local
machine's configuration from a remote server and apply it. In order to
successfully communicate with the remote server, the client must have a
certificate signed by a certificate authority that the server trusts;
the recommended method for this, at the moment, is to run a certificate
authority as part of the puppet server (which is the default). The
client will connect and request a signed certificate, and will continue
connecting until it receives one.</p>

<p>Once the client has a signed certificate, it will retrieve its
configuration and apply it.</p>

<h2 id="USAGE-NOTES">USAGE NOTES</h2>

<p>'puppet agent' does its best to find a compromise between interactive
use and daemon use. Run with no arguments and no configuration, it will
go into the background, attempt to get a signed certificate, and retrieve
and apply its configuration every 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Some flags are meant specifically for interactive use -- in particular,
'test', 'tags' and 'fingerprint' are useful.</p>

<p>'--test' does a single run in the foreground with verbose logging, then exits.
It will also exit if it can't get a valid catalog. The exit code after running
with '--test' is 0 if the catalog was successfully applied, and 1 if the run
either failed or wasn't attempted (due to another run already in progress).</p>

<p>'--tags' allows you to specify what portions of a configuration you want
to apply. Puppet elements are tagged with all of the class or definition
names that contain them, and you can use the 'tags' flag to specify one
of these names, causing only configuration elements contained within
that class or definition to be applied. This is very useful when you are
testing new configurations -- for instance, if you are just starting to
manage 'ntpd', you would put all of the new elements into an 'ntpd'
class, and call puppet with '--tags ntpd', which would only apply that
small portion of the configuration during your testing, rather than
applying the whole thing.</p>

<p>'--fingerprint' is a one-time flag. In this mode 'puppet agent' will run
once and display on the console (and in the log) the current certificate
(or certificate request) fingerprint. Providing the '--digest' option
allows to use a different digest algorithm to generate the fingerprint.
The main use is to verify that before signing a certificate request on
the master, the certificate request the master received is the same as
the one the client sent (to prevent against man-in-the-middle attacks
when signing certificates).</p>

<h2 id="OPTIONS">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>Note that any Puppet setting that's valid in the configuration file is also a
valid long argument. For example, 'server' is a valid setting, so you can
specify '--server <var>servername</var>' as an argument. Boolean settings translate into
'--setting' and '--no-setting' pairs.</p>

<p>See the configuration file documentation at
http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/stable/configuration.html for the
full list of acceptable settings. A commented list of all settings can also be
generated by running puppet agent with '--genconfig'.</p>

<dl>
<dt>--certname</dt><dd><p>Set the certname (unique ID) of the client. The master reads this
unique identifying string, which is usually set to the node's
fully-qualified domain name, to determine which configurations the
node will receive. Use this option to debug setup problems or
implement unusual node identification schemes.
(This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf.)</p></dd>
<dt>--daemonize</dt><dd><p>Send the process into the background. This is the default.
(This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf. Note the special 'no-'
prefix for boolean settings on the command line.)</p></dd>
<dt>--no-daemonize</dt><dd><p>Do not send the process into the background.
(This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf. Note the special 'no-'
prefix for boolean settings on the command line.)</p></dd>
<dt class="flush">--debug</dt><dd><p>Enable full debugging.</p></dd>
<dt>--detailed-exitcodes</dt><dd><p>Provide extra information about the run via exit codes; only works if '--test'
or '--onetime' is also specified. If enabled, 'puppet agent' will use the
following exit codes:</p>

<p>0: The run succeeded with no changes or failures; the system was already in
the desired state.</p>

<p>1: The run failed, or wasn't attempted due to another run already in progress.</p>

<p>2: The run succeeded, and some resources were changed.</p>

<p>4: The run succeeded, and some resources failed.</p>

<p>6: The run succeeded, and included both changes and failures.</p></dd>
<dt>--digest</dt><dd><p>Change the certificate fingerprinting digest algorithm. The default is
SHA256. Valid values depends on the version of OpenSSL installed, but
will likely contain MD5, MD2, SHA1 and SHA256.</p></dd>
<dt>--disable</dt><dd><p>Disable working on the local system. This puts a lock file in place,
causing 'puppet agent' not to work on the system until the lock file
is removed. This is useful if you are testing a configuration and do
not want the central configuration to override the local state until
everything is tested and committed.</p>

<p>Disable can also take an optional message that will be reported by the
'puppet agent' at the next disabled run.</p>

<p>'puppet agent' uses the same lock file while it is running, so no more
than one 'puppet agent' process is working at a time.</p>

<p>'puppet agent' exits after executing this.</p></dd>
<dt>--enable</dt><dd><p>Enable working on the local system. This removes any lock file,
causing 'puppet agent' to start managing the local system again
(although it will continue to use its normal scheduling, so it might
not start for another half hour).</p>

<p>'puppet agent' exits after executing this.</p></dd>
<dt>--fingerprint</dt><dd><p>Display the current certificate or certificate signing request
fingerprint and then exit. Use the '--digest' option to change the
digest algorithm used.</p></dd>
<dt class="flush">--help</dt><dd><p>Print this help message</p></dd>
<dt>--logdest</dt><dd><p>Where to send log messages. Choose between 'syslog' (the POSIX syslog
service), 'eventlog' (the Windows Event Log), 'console', or the path to a log
file. If debugging or verbosity is enabled, this defaults to 'console'.
Otherwise, it defaults to 'syslog' on POSIX systems and 'eventlog' on Windows.</p>

<p>A path ending with '.json' will receive structured output in JSON format. The
log file will not have an ending ']' automatically written to it due to the
appending nature of logging. It must be appended manually to make the content
valid JSON.</p></dd>
<dt>--masterport</dt><dd><p>The port on which to contact the puppet master.
(This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf.)</p></dd>
<dt class="flush">--noop</dt><dd><p>Use 'noop' mode where the daemon runs in a no-op or dry-run mode. This
is useful for seeing what changes Puppet will make without actually
executing the changes.
(This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf. Note the special 'no-'
prefix for boolean settings on the command line.)</p></dd>
<dt>--onetime</dt><dd><p>Run the configuration once. Runs a single (normally daemonized) Puppet
run. Useful for interactively running puppet agent when used in
conjunction with the --no-daemonize option.
(This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf. Note the special 'no-'
prefix for boolean settings on the command line.)</p></dd>
<dt class="flush">--test</dt><dd><p>Enable the most common options used for testing. These are 'onetime',
'verbose', 'ignorecache', 'no-daemonize', 'no-usecacheonfailure',
'detailed-exitcodes', 'no-splay', and 'show_diff'.</p></dd>
<dt>--verbose</dt><dd><p>Turn on verbose reporting.</p></dd>
<dt>--version</dt><dd><p>Print the puppet version number and exit.</p></dd>
<dt>--waitforcert</dt><dd><p>This option only matters for daemons that do not yet have certificates
and it is enabled by default, with a value of 120 (seconds). This
causes 'puppet agent' to connect to the server every 2 minutes and ask
it to sign a certificate request. This is useful for the initial setup
of a puppet client. You can turn off waiting for certificates by
specifying a time of 0.
(This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf. Note the special 'no-'
prefix for boolean settings on the command line.)</p></dd>
