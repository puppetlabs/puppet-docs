There are three\nmain ways for an exec to be idempotent:\n\n* The command itself is already idempotent. (For example, `apt-get update`.)\n* The exec has an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` attribute, which prevents\n  Puppet from running the command unless some condition is met.\n* The exec has `refreshonly => true`, which only allows Puppet to run the\n  command when some other resource is changed. (See the notes on refreshing\n  below.)\n\nA caution: There's a widespread tendency to use collections of execs to\nmanage resources that aren't covered by an existing resource type. This\nworks fine for simple tasks, but once your exec pile gets complex enough\nthat you really have to think to understand what's happening, you should\nconsider developing a custom resource type instead, as it will be much\nmore predictable and maintainable.\n\n**Refresh:** `exec` resources can respond to refresh events (via\n`notify`, `subscribe`, or the `~>` arrow). The refresh behavior of execs\nis non-standard, and can be affected by the `refresh` and\n`refreshonly` attributes:\n\n* If `refreshonly` is set to true, the exec will _only_ run when it receives an\n  event. This is the most reliable way to use refresh with execs.\n* If the exec already would have run and receives an event, it will run its\n  command **up to two times.** (If an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` condition\n  is no longer met after the first run, the second run will not occur.)\n* If the exec already would have run, has a `refresh` command, and receives an\n  event, it will run its normal command, then run its `refresh` command\n  (as long as any `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` conditions are still met\n  after the normal command finishes).\n* If the exec would **not** have run (due to an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates`\n  attribute) and receives an event, it still will not run.\n* If the exec has `noop => true`, would otherwise have run, and receives\n  an event from a non-noop resource, it will run once (or run its `refresh`\n  command instead, if it has one).\n\nIn short: If there's a possibility of your exec receiving refresh events,\nit becomes doubly important to make sure the run conditions are restricted.\n\n**Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing an exec's cwd or the executable\nfile used in an exec's command, the exec resource will autorequire those\nfiles.

The Win32 APIs define exit codes as 32-bit unsigned integers, but\nboth the cmd.exe shell and the .NET runtime cast them to signed\nintegers. This means some tools will report negative numbers for exit\ncodes above 2147483647. (For example, cmd.exe reports 4294967295 as -1.)\nSince Puppet uses the plain Win32 APIs, it will report the very large\nnumber instead of the negative number, which might not be what you\nexpect if you got the exit code from a cmd.exe session.\n\nMicrosoft recommends against using negative/very large exit codes, and\nyou should avoid them when possible.

Values can match `/./`.","kind":"property","namevar":false},"ensure":{"description":"Whether the file should exist, and if so what kind of file it should be.\nPossible values are `present`, `absent`, `file`, `directory`, and `link`.\n\n* `present` will accept any form of file existence, and will create a\n  normal file if the file is missing. (The file will have no content\n  unless the `content` or `source` attribute is used.)\n* `absent` will make sure the file doesn't exist, deleting it\n  if necessary.\n* `file` will make sure it's a normal file, and enables use of the\n  `content` or `source` attribute.\n* `directory` will make sure it's a directory, and enables use of the\n  `source`, `recurse`, `recurselimit`, `ignore`, and `purge` attributes.\n* `link` will make sure the file is a symlink, and **requires** that you\n  also set the `target` attribute. Symlinks are supported on all Posix\n  systems and on Windows Vista / 2008 and higher. On Windows, managing\n  symlinks requires puppet agent's user account to have the \"Create\n  Symbolic Links\" privilege; this can be configured in the \"User Rights\n  Assignment\" section in the Windows policy editor. By default, puppet\n  agent runs as the Administrator account, which does have this privilege.\n\nPuppet avoids destroying directories unless the `force` attribute is set\nto `true`. This means that if a file is currently a directory, setting\n`ensure` to anything but `directory` or `present` will cause Puppet to\nskip managing the resource and log either a notice or an error.\n\nThere is one other non-standard value for `ensure`. If you specify the\npath to another file as the ensure value, it is equivalent to specifying\n`link` and using that path as the `target`:\n\n    # Equivalent resources:\n\n    file { \"/etc/inetd.conf\":\n      ensure => \"/etc/inet/inetd.conf\",\n    }\n\n    file { \"/etc/inetd.conf\":\n      ensure => link,\n      target => \"/etc/inet/inetd.conf\",\n    }\n\nHowever, we recommend using `link` and `target` explicitly, since this\nbehavior can be harder to read.\n\nValid values are `absent` (also called `false`), `file`, `present`, `directory`, `link`.

This value **must** be specified as a string; do not use\nun-quoted numbers to represent file modes.\n\nThe `file` type uses traditional Unix permission schemes and translates\nthem to equivalent permissions for systems which represent permissions\ndifferently, including Windows. For detailed ACL controls on Windows,\nyou can leave `mode` unmanaged and use\n[the puppetlabs/acl module.](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/acl)\n\nNumeric modes should use the standard octal notation of\n`<SETUID/SETGID/STICKY><OWNER><GROUP><OTHER>` (e.g. '0644').\n\n* Each of the \"owner,\" \"group,\" and \"other\" digits should be a sum of the\n  permissions for that class of users, where read = 4, write = 2, and\n  execute/search = 1.\n* The setuid/setgid/sticky digit is also a sum, where setuid = 4, setgid = 2,\n  and sticky = 1.\n* The setuid/setgid/sticky digit is optional. If it is absent, Puppet will\n  clear any existing setuid/setgid/sticky permissions. (So to make your intent\n  clear, you should use at least four digits for numeric modes.)\n* When specifying numeric permissions for directories, Puppet sets the search\n  permission wherever the read permission is set.\n\nSymbolic modes should be represented as a string of comma-separated\npermission clauses, in the form `<WHO><OP><PERM>`:\n\n* \"Who\" should be u (user), g (group), o (other), and/or a (all)\n* \"Op\" should be = (set exact permissions), + (add select permissions),\n  or - (remove select permissions)\n* \"Perm\" should be one or more of:\n    * r (read)\n    * w (write)\n    * x (execute/search)\n    * t (sticky)\n    * s (setuid/setgid)\n    * X (execute/search if directory or if any one user can execute)\n    * u (user's current permissions)\n    * g (group's current permissions)\n    * o (other's current permissions)\n\nThus, mode `0664` could be represented symbolically as either `a=r,ug+w`\nor `ug=rw,o=r`.  However, symbolic modes are more expressive than numeric\nmodes: a mode only affects the specified bits, so `mode => 'ug+w'` will\nset the user and group write bits, without affecting any other bits.\n\nSee the manual page for GNU or BSD `chmod` for more details\non numeric and symbolic modes.\n\nOn Windows, permissions are translated as follows:\n\n* Owner and group names are mapped to Windows SIDs\n* The \"other\" class of users maps to the \"Everyone\" SID\n* The read/write/execute permissions map to the `FILE_GENERIC_READ`,\n  `FILE_GENERIC_WRITE`, and `FILE_GENERIC_EXECUTE` access rights; a\n  file's owner always has the `FULL_CONTROL` right\n* \"Other\" users can't have any permissions a file's group lacks,\n  and its group can't have any permissions its owner lacks; that is, 0644\n  is an acceptable mode, but 0464 is not.","kind":"property","namevar":false},"type":{"description":"A read-only state to check the file type.","kind":"property","namevar":false},"seluser":{"description":"What the SELinux user component of the context of the file should be.\nAny valid SELinux user component is accepted.

Resources can be limited to a schedule by using the\n[`schedule`](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/metaparameter.html#schedule)\nmetaparameter.\n\nCurrently, **schedules can only be used to stop a resource from being\napplied;** they cannot cause a resource to be applied when it otherwise\nwouldn't be, and they cannot accurately specify a time when a resource\nshould run.\n\nEvery time Puppet applies its configuration, it will apply the\nset of resources whose schedule does not eliminate them from\nrunning right then, but there is currently no system in place to\nguarantee that a given resource runs at a given time.  If you\nspecify a very  restrictive schedule and Puppet happens to run at a\ntime within that schedule, then the resources will get applied;\notherwise, that work may never get done.\n\nThus, it is advisable to use wider scheduling (e.g., over a couple of\nhours) combined with periods and repetitions.  For instance, if you\nwanted to restrict certain resources to only running once, between\nthe hours of two and 4 AM, then you would use this schedule:\n\n    schedule { 'maint':\n      range  => \"2 - 4\",\n      period => daily,\n      repeat => 1,\n    }\n\nWith this schedule, the first time that Puppet runs between 2 and 4 AM,\nall resources with this schedule will get applied, but they won't\nget applied again between 2 and 4 because they will have already\nrun once that day, and they won't get applied outside that schedule\nbecause they will be outside the scheduled range.\n\nPuppet automatically creates a schedule for each of the valid periods\nwith the same name as that period (e.g., hourly and daily).\nAdditionally, a schedule named `puppet` is created and used as the\ndefault, with the following attributes:\n\n    schedule { 'puppet':\n      period => hourly,\n      repeat => 2,\n    }\n\nThis will cause resources to be applied every 30 minutes by default.","attributes":{"name":{"description":"The name of the schedule.

For instance:\n\n    schedule { 'maintenance':\n      range => \"1:30 - 4:30\",\n    }\n\nThis is mostly useful for restricting certain resources to being\napplied in maintenance windows or during off-peak hours.

Take this schedule:\n\n    schedule { 'veryoften':\n      period => hourly,\n      repeat => 6,\n    }\n\nThis can cause Puppet to apply that resource up to every 10 minutes.\n\nAt the moment, Puppet cannot guarantee that level of repetition; that\nis, the resource can applied _up to_ every 10 minutes, but internal\nfactors might prevent it from actually running that often (e.g. if a\nPuppet run is still in progress when the next run is scheduled to start,\nthat next run will be suppressed).\n\nSee the `periodmatch` attribute for tuning whether to match\ntimes by their distance apart or by their specific value.\n\nValid values are `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `never`.","kind":"parameter","namevar":false},"repeat":{"description":"How often a given resource may be applied in this schedule's `period`.\nDefaults to 1; must be an integer.","kind":"parameter","namevar":false},"weekday":{"description":"The days of the week in which the schedule should be valid.\nYou may specify the full day name (Tuesday), the three character\nabbreviation (Tue), or a number corresponding to the day of the\nweek where 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc. Multiple days can be specified\nas an array. If not specified, the day of the week will not be\nconsidered in the schedule.\n\nIf you are also using a range match that spans across midnight\nthen this parameter will match the day that it was at the start\nof the range, not necessarily the day that it is when it matches.\nFor example, consider this schedule:\n\n    schedule { 'maintenance_window':\n      range   => '22:00 - 04:00',\n      weekday => 'Saturday',\n    }\n\nThis will match at 11 PM on Saturday and 2 AM on Sunday, but not\nat 2 AM on Saturday.","kind":"parameter","namevar":false}},"features":{},"providers":{}},"scheduled_task":{"description":"Installs and manages Windows Scheduled Tasks.
