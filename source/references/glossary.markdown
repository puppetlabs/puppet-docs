[Relationships and Ordering]: /puppet/latest/reference/lang_relationships.html

An accurate, shared vocabulary goes a long way to ensure the success of a project. To that end, this glossary defines the most common terms that Puppet users rely on.

### abstract data type

See [type (data)](#type-data).

### attribute

Attributes specify the desired state of a given configuration resource. Each resource type has a different set of attributes, and each attribute has its own set of allowed [values](#value). For example, a package resource (like `vim`) would have an `ensure` attribute, whose value could be `present`, `latest`, `absent`, or a version number:

~~~ ruby
package {'vim':
  ensure   => present,
  provider => apt,
}
~~~

You specify an attribute's value with the `=>` operator, and pairs of attributes and values are separated by commas.

### agent

(or **Puppet agent**, or **agent node**)

"**Puppet agent**" can refer to a few different things:

* **The Puppet agent software package,** also known as [`puppet-agent`](/puppet/latest/reference/about_agent.html). Puppet is usually deployed in a simple client-server arrangement. When you install Puppet on a device, you're installing the agent software and its associated tools and dependencies. On *nix systems, this package is called `puppet-agent`.
* **The `puppet agent` daemon.** You can invoke the agent software by running the `puppet agent` command, or you can let it run in the background as a daemon.
* **A [node](#node) running the Puppet agent software.** By association, a [node](#node) running the Puppet agent daemon can be referred to as an **agent node**, or simply "agent".

A Puppet agent regularly performs [Puppet runs](#puppet-run), wherein it sends [facts](#fact) to a Puppet [master](#master) and receives a configuration [catalog](#catalog), then applies the catalog to the local system using its [providers](#provider).

> **Note:** Puppet masters typically also run the Puppet agent daemon, which allows Puppet to manage its own configuration. In this sense, a Puppet master can also be a Puppet agent. An agent can also serve as its own master; this is often called a **masterless** configuration.

For more information about Puppet's agent-master architecture, see [the Puppet documentation](/puppet/latest/reference/architecture.html).

### catalog

A **catalog** describes the desired state of each managed resource on a node. It is a [compilation](#compilation) of all the [resources](#resource) that the Puppet [agent](#agent) applies to a given [node](#node), as well as the relationships between those resources.

Catalogs are compiled by a Puppet [master](#master) from [manifests](#manifest) and agent-provided data (such as [facts](#fact), certificates, and an [environment](#environment) if one is provided), as well as optional external data (such as data from an [external node classifier](#external-node-classifier),  [exported resources](#exported-resource), and [functions](#function)). The master then serves the compiled catalog to the agent when requested.

Unlike the manifests from which they were compiled, catalogs don't contain any conditional logic or [functions](#function). They are unambiguous, relevant to only a specific node, and generated by a [node](#node).

For detailed information, see the [Catalog Compilation](/puppet/latest/reference/subsystem_catalog_compilation.html) page in the Puppet documentation. See also [node graph](#node-graph), a tool in [Puppet Enterprise](#puppet-enterprise) that interactively visualizes a node's catalog.

### class

A **class** is a collection of related [resources](#resource) that, once [defined](#define), can be [declared](#declare) as a single unit. For example, a class can contain all of the resources (such as files, settings, [modules](#module), and scripts) needed to configure the Apache webserver on a host. Classes can also declare other classes. For more information, see the [Classes](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_classes.html) page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

Classes are [singletons](#singleton) and can be applied only once in a given configuration; although the `include` function allows you to declare a class multiple times, Puppet evaluates it only once.

The `require` and `contain` functions can create [relationships](#relationship) between classes. For more information, see the [Containment of Resources](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_containment.html) page in the Puppet language reference.

> **Note:** Being singletons, Puppet classes are not analogous to classes in object-oriented programming languages. Object-oriented classes are like templates that can be instantiated multiple times; Puppet's equivalent to this concept is [defined types](#type-defined).

### classify

(or **node classification**)

To assign [classes](#class) to a [node](#node), as well as provide any data required by the classes, you **classify** the node.

By writing a class, you enable a set of configurations. By classifying a node with the class, you describe the node's desired configuration.

You can classify nodes through [node definitions](#node-definition) in the [main manifest](#main-manifest), or with the [Puppet Enterprise](#puppet-enterprise) [Node Manager](#node-manager) or an [external node classifier](#external-node-classifier).

### compilation

A Puppet [master](#master) creates a [catalog](#catalog) by **compiling** [manifests](#manifest) and agent-provided data, as well as any provided external data. During a [Puppet run](#puppet-run), an agent requests its [node's](#node) compiled catalog, then applies it to configure the node. For detailed information, see the [Catalog Compilation](/puppet/latest/reference/subsystem_catalog_compilation.html#whats-a-catalog) page in the Puppet documentation.

### core data type

(or **concrete data type**)

See [type (data)](#type-data).

### console

[Puppet Enterprise](#puppet-enterprise) includes a web user interface called the **console**, which provides tools for managing your Puppet infrastructure. For example, you can use it to [classify nodes](#node-manager), manage Puppet services, trigger and view [reports](#report) and metrics about [Puppet runs](#puppet-run) and activity, and examine inventory data and [resources](#resource). For detailed information, see [the Puppet Enterprise documentation](/pe/latest/console_accessing.html).

### data type

See [type (data)](#type-data).

### declare

To direct Puppet to include a given [class](#class) or [resource](#resource) in a given configuration, you **declare** it using the [Puppet language](#puppet-language). To declare classes, use a [function](#function) (such as `include`) or the `class {'foo':}` syntax. To declare resources, use the lowercase `file {'/tmp/bar':}` syntax.

You can configure a resource or class when you declare it by including [attribute-value pairs](#attribute).

For more information, see the [Declaring Classes](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_classes.html#declaring-classes) section and [Resources](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_resources.html) page in the Puppet language reference. Contrast with "[define](#define)."

### define

To specify the contents and behavior of a [class](#class) or a [defined type](#type-defined), you **define** it using the [Puppet language](#puppet-language). Defining a class or type doesn't automatically include it in a configuration; it simply makes it available to be [declared](#declare).

For more information, see the [Defined Types](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_defined_types.html)

### define (noun)

(or **definition**)

As a noun, **define** is an older term for a [defined type](#type-defined). For instance, a module might refer to its available defines.

### define (keyword)

You use the **`define`** [Puppet language](#puppet-language) keyword to create a [defined type](#type-defined).

### defined resource

A [resource](#resource) whose [type](#type) has been [define](#defined). See [type (defined)](#type-defined).

### defined type

(or **defined resource type**)

See [type (defined)](#type-defined).

### ENC

See [external node classifier](#external-node-classifier).

### environment

An **environment** is an isolated group of Puppet [agent nodes](#agent) that a Puppet [master](#master) can serve with its own [main manifest](#main-manifest) and set of [modules](#modules). For example, you can use environments to set up scratch [nodes](#node) for testing before rolling out changes to production, or divide a site by types of hardware.

For more information, see the [About Environments](/puppet/latest/reference/environments.html) page.

### exported resource

An **exported resource** is a [resource](#resource) that you've [declared](#declare) to be available to other [node](#node) that can then collect the exported resource and manage their own copies. This lets you share a resource's desired state across nodes, such as when one node depends on information on another node for its configuration, or when you need to monitor a resource's state.

For more information, see [the Exported Resources page](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_exported.html) in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### expression

The [Puppet language](#puppet-language) supports several types of **expressions** for comparison and evaluation purposes, including Boolean expressions, comparison expressions, and arithmetic expressions. For more information, see [the Expressions page](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_expressions.html) in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### external node classifier

(or **ENC**)

An **external node classifier** (ENC) is an executable script that returns information about which [classes](#class) to apply to a [node](#node) when called by a Puppet [master](#master).

ENCs provide an alternative to using a [site's](#site) [main manifest](#main-manifest) to classify nodes. An ENC can be written in any language, and can use information from any data source (such as an LDAP database) when classifying nodes.

An ENC is called with the name of the node to be classified as an argument, and should return a YAML document describing the node. For more information, see the [External Nodes](/guides/external_nodes.html) guide.

### fact

A piece of information about a [node](#node), such as its hostname, IP address, and operating system, is a **fact**.

[Facter](#facter) reads facts from a node and makes them available to Puppet. You can extend Facter with custom facts, which can expose [site-specific](#site) details of your systems to your Puppet [manifests](#manifest). For more information, see the [Custom Facts](/facter/latest/custom_facts.html) documentation.

### Facter

**Facter** is Puppet's system inventory tool. Facter reads [facts](#fact) about a [node](#node), such as its hostname, IP address, and operating system, and makes them available to Puppet.

Facter includes many built-in facts, and you can view their names and [values](#value) for the local system by running `facter` at a node's command line.

In [agent](#agent)/[master](#master) Puppet arrangements, Puppet agents send their nodes' facts to the Puppet master.

For more information, see [the Facter documentation](/facter/latest/).

### filebucket

A repository in which Puppet stores file backups when it has to replace files is called a **filebucket**.

A filebucket can be local (and owned by the [node](#node) being managed) or site-global (and owned by the Puppet [master](#master)). Typically, a single filebucket is defined for a network and is used as the default backup location. For more information, see the [`filebucket` type](/puppet/latest/reference/type.html#filebucket) in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) type reference.

### function

A **function** is a [Puppet language](#puppet-language) statement that returns a [value](#value) or modifies a [catalog](#catalog). Puppet has many [built-in functions](/puppet/latest/reference/function.html), and Puppet [modules](#module) can add their own functions. You can also [write custom functions](/guides/custom_functions.html).

Functions generally take at least one [value](#value) as an argument, execute Puppet code, and return a value. Since Puppet evaluates functions during [compilation](#compilation), the Puppet [master](#master) executes them in an [agent](#agent)-master arrangement. Puppet functions can only access the [facts](#fact) that an agent submitted.

Contrast with "[lambda](#lambda)".

### global scope

See [scope](#scope).

### Hiera

The **Hiera** tool, which ships with the [Puppet agent](#agent), provides hierarchical key-value lookup for [site-specific](#site) data. This lets you take site-specific data out of your [manifests](#manifest) and place it in a centralized location, while also setting default data and overriding certain specified [values](#value) when necessary. For more information, see [the Hiera documentation](/hiera/latest/).

### host

Any device, physical or virtual, attached to a network is a **host**.

In the Puppet documentation, this can also refer to a device running the Puppet [agent](#agent) daemon. See also [node](#node).

### host (resource type)

A **host** can refer to an entry in a system's `hosts` file, and is used for name resolution. Puppet includes a [type](#type) of [resource](#resource) to manage hosts. For more information, see the [Host](/puppet/latest/reference/type.html#host) section of the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) type reference.

### idempotent

**Idempotence** refers to the concept of doing something multiple times with the same outcome. Puppet [resources](#resource) are idempotent, since they describe a desired final state rather than a series of steps to follow.

The most prominent exception among Puppet resources is the `exec` [resource type](#type), which should be idempotent but rely on the user to design them accordingly.

### inheritance (class)

A Puppet [class](#class) can be derived from another class by using the `inherits` keyword. The derived class [declares](#declare) all of the same [resources](#resource), but can override some of their [attributes](#attribute) and add new resources. Inheritance should be used very sparingly; for more information, see the [Classes](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_classes.html#inheritance) page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### lambda

(or **code block**)

A **lambda** is a block of parameterized [Puppet language](#puppet-language) code that you can pass to certain [functions](#function). For more information, see the [Lambdas (Code Blocks)](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_lambdas.html) page in the Puppet language reference.

### local scope

See [scope](#scope).

### main manifest

(or **site manifest**)

The **main manifest** is the main "point of entry" [manifest](#manifest) used by a Puppet [master](#master) when [compiling](#compilation) a [catalog](#catalog).

The location of this manifest is set with the `manifest` setting in [`environment.conf`](/puppet/latest/reference/config_file_environment.html), with a default location set by the `default_manifest` setting in [`puppet.conf`](/puppet/latest/reference/config_file_main.html).

For more information, see the [Main Manifests](/puppet/latest/reference/dirs_manifest.html) page of the Puppet documentation.

### manifest

(or **Puppet code**)

A **manifest** file contains code written in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) and is named with the `.pp` file extension. The **Puppet code** in a manifest can:

* [Declare](#declare) [resources](#resource) and [classes](#class)
* Set [variables](#variable)
* Evaluate [functions](#function)
* [Define](#define) [classes](#class), [defined types](#type-defined), [functions](#function), and [nodes](#node-definition)

Most manifests are contained in [modules](#module). Every manifest in a module should [define](#define) a single class, defined type, or function.

The Puppet [master](#master) service reads an [environment's](#environment) [main manifest](#main-manifest). This manifest usually defines [nodes](#node-definition), so that each managed [agent](#agent) receives a unique [catalog](#catalog).

See also [main manifest](#main-manifest).

### manifest ordering

Puppet uses **manifest ordering** to apply unrelated [resources](#resource) in the order that they're declared in their [manifests](#manifest). For related resources, or for more information about manifest ordering, see the [Relationships and Ordering][] page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### master

(or **Puppet master**)

In a standard Puppet client-server deployment, the server is known as the **Puppet master**. The Puppet master [compiles](#compilation) and serves configuration [catalogs](#catalog) on demand to Puppet [agents](#agent) on client [nodes](#node).

The Puppet master provides catalogs to agents using an HTTP server. It can run as a standalone daemon with a built-in web server, or as part of [Puppet Server](#puppet-server). (We don't recommend using the built-in daemon when managing more than 10 nodes.)

For more information, see the [Overview of Puppet's Architecture](/puppet/latest/reference/architecture.html) page in the Puppet documentation.

### masterless

"**Masterless**" is a term often used to refer to a Puppet [node](#node) that does not rely on a [master](#master) for its [catalog](#catalog). See [agent](#agent).

### metaparameter

A **metaparameter** is a [resource](#resource) [attribute](#attribute) that can be specified for any type of resource. Metaparameters are part of Puppet's framework rather than part of a specific [type](#type), and usually affect the way resources relate to each other. For a list of metaparameters and their usage, see the [Metaparameter Reference](/puppet/latest/reference/metaparameter.html).

### module

A collection of [classes](#class), [resource](#resource) [types](#type), files, [functions](#function) and [templates](#template), organized around a particular purpose is a **module**. For example, a module can configure an Apache webserver instance or Rails application. There are many modules available for download in the [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/). For more information, see:

For more information, see the [Module Fundamentals](/puppet/latest/reference/modules_fundamentals.html) and [Installing Modules](/puppet/latest/reference/modules_installing.html) pages in the Puppet documentation.

### namevar

(or **name**)

This [attribute](#attribute) represents a [resource's](#resource) unique identity on the target system. For example, two different files cannot have the same `path`, and two different services cannot have the same `name`.

Every resource [type](#type) has a designated namevar, usually `name`. Some types, such as [`file`](/puppet/latest/reference/type.html#file) or [`exec`](/puppet/latest/reference/type.html#exec), have their own (in these cases, `path` and `command`, respectively). If a type's namevar is something other than `name`, it's called out in the [type reference](/puppet/latest/reference/type.html).

If you don't specify a [value](#value) for a resource's namevar when you [declare](#declare) it, it defaults to that resource's [title](#title).

### node

A **node** is a device managed by Puppet. Some nodes are [masters](#master), which [compile](#compilation) [manifests](#manifest) into [catalogs](#catalog); most nodes, including most masters, are [agents](#agent), which receive catalogs and apply them to the node during a [Puppet run](#puppet-run). Most nodes are computers (such as workstations and servers), but some aren't (such as supported network switches and storage appliances).

A node is also one of the fundamental units of a [puppetized](#puppetize) infrastructure. See also [classification](#classify), [node definition](#node-definition), and [node scope](#node-scope).

For general information about Puppet's architecture, see [the Puppet documentation](/puppet/latest/reference/architecture.html).

### node definition

(or **node statement**)

A **node definition** is a collection of [classes](#class), [resources](#resource), and [variables](#variable) in a [manifest](#manifest) that are only applied to a certain [agent node](#agent). Node definitions begin with the `node` keyword, and can match a node by full name or regular expression.

When a [node](#node) retrieves or [compiles](#compilation) its [catalog](#catalog), it receives the contents of a single matching node statement as well as any classes or resources declared outside any node statement. The classes in every _other_ node statement are hidden from that node.

For more information, see the [node definitions](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_node_definitions.html) in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### node graph

The **node graph** in [Puppet Enterprise's](#puppet-enterprise) [Configuration Manager](#configuration-manager) provides a graphic representation of a [node's](#node) [resources](#resource). For more information, see the [Configuration Management overview](/pe/latest/CM_overview.html) in the Puppet Enterprise documentation.

### Node Manager

The **Node Manager** app lets you [classify](#classify) [nodes](#node) using [fact-based](#fact) rules in the [Puppet Enterprise](#puppet-enterprise) [console](#console). It's one of two main workspaces in Puppet Enterprise, along with [Configuration Manager](#configuration-manager).

### node scope

See [scope](#scope).

### node state

When Puppet manages a [node](#node) during a [Puppet run](#puppet-run), it attempts bring it into compliance with its [catalog](#catalog). When using the [Node Manager](#node-manager) in [Puppet Enterprise](#puppet-enterprise), the result is considered the **node state**. In most cases, a node's state is either:

* **Changed**, by a successful [Puppet run](#puppet-run) that modified the node into compliance.
* **Unchanged**, by a successful Puppet run that determined the node was already compliant.
* **Failed**, when a Puppet run fails while evaluating or modifying the node.

When a [no-op](#no-op) Puppet run determines that it would have modified the node during a normal Puppet run, the node state is **no-op**. If a node is unresponsive for a period of time, its node state is **unresponsive**. If a node has never reported to a master, its node state is **unreported**.

For more information, see the [Configuration Management overview](/pe/latest/CM_overview.html) in the Puppet Enterprise documentation.

### no-op

(or **noop**)

By running Puppet in **no-op** mode (short for "No Operations" mode), you can simulate what Puppet will do without actually changing anything. No-op mode allows you to perform a [dry run](#dry-run) that logs planned activity but doesn't affect any [nodes](#node). To run Puppet in no-op mode, execute `puppet agent` or `puppet apply` with the `--noop` option.

### notify

A notification [relationship](#relationship) set with the `notify` [metaparameter](#metaparameter) or the wavy [chaining arrow](#chaining-arrow) (`~>`). For more information, see the [Relationships and Ordering][] page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### notification

A type of [relationship](#relationship) that both declares an order for resources and causes [refresh](#refresh) events to be sent. For more information, see the [Relationships and Ordering][] page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### ordering

By **ordering** [resources](#resource), you determine which resources should be managed before others.

By default, Puppet uses [manifest ordering](#manifest-ordering), which evaluates resources in the same order they're declared in their [manifests](#manifest). Puppet also obeys [relationships](#relationship) you provide that determine whether a resource depends on other resources. For more information, see the [Relationships and Ordering][] page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference and the [ordering](/puppet/latest/reference/configuration.html#ordering) section in the Puppet configuration reference.

### parameter

Generally speaking, a **parameter** is a chunk of information that a [class](#class) or [resource](#resource) can accept. See also:

* [parameter (custom type and provider development)](#parameter-custom-type-and-provider-development)
* [parameter (defined types and parameterized classes)](#parameter-defined-types-and-parameterized-classes)
* [parameter (external nodes)](#parameter-external-nodes)

### parameter (custom type and provider development)

This type of parameter does not call a method on a [provider](#provider). They are eventually expressed as [attributes](#attributes) in instances of this [resource](#resource) [type](#type). For more information, see the [Custom Types](/guides/custom_types.html) guide.

### parameter (defined types and parameterized classes)

This type of parameter is a [variable](#variable) in the [definition](#define) of a [class](#class) or [defined type](#type-defined), whose [value](#value) is set by a [resource](#resource) [attribute](#attribute) when an instance of that type or class is [declared](#declare).

~~~ ruby
define my_new_type ($my_parameter) {
  file { "$title":
    ensure  => file,
    content => $my_parameter,
  }
}

my_new_type { '/tmp/test_file':
  my_parameter => "This text will become the content of the file.",
}
~~~

The parameters you use when defining a type or class define the attributes available when the type or class is declared.

### parameter (external nodes)

This type of parameter is a top-scope [variable](#variable) set by an [external node classifier](#external-node-classifier). Although these are called "parameters," they are just normal variables; the name refers to how they are usually used to configure the behavior of [classes](#class).

### design pattern

A **design pattern** is a colloquial term used to describe a collection of related [manifests](#manifest) that are designed to solve an issue or manage a particular configuration item. For example, an "Apache pattern" refers to the manifests designed to configure Apache. See also [module](#module).

### plusignment operator

The **plusignment** (`+>`) **operator** adds [values](#value) to [resource](#resource) [attributes](#attribute) using the plusignment syntax. This is useful when you want to override resource attributes without having to specify already-declared values a second time. For more information, see the [Appending to Resource Attributes](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_classes.html#appending-to-resource-attributes) section in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### profile

A **profile** represents the configuration of a technology stack for a [site](#site) and typically consists of one or more [classes](#class). A [role](#role) can include as many profiles as required to define itself. Profiles are included in [role and profile modules](#role-and-profile-module).

For more information about roles and profiles, see [the Puppet Enterprise documentation](/pe/latest/puppet_assign_configurations.html#assigning-configuration-data-with-role-and-profile-modules).

### property (custom type and provider development)

A **property** is a [value](#value) that corresponds to an observable part of the target [node's](#node) state. When retrieving a [resource's](#resource) state, a property calls the specified method on the [provider](#provider), which reads the state from the system. If the current state does not match the specified state, the provider  changes it.

Properties appear as [attributes](#attribute) when [declaring](#declare) instances of this resource [type](#type). For more information, see the [Custom Types](/guides/custom_types.html) guide.

### provider

**Providers** implement [resource](#resource) [types](#type) on a specific type of system by using the system's own tools. The division between types and providers allows a single resource type (like [`package`](/puppet/latest/reference/type.html#package)) to manage packages on many different systems (using, for example, `yum` on Red Hat systems, `dpkg` and `apt` on Debian-based systems, and `ports` on BSD systems).

Providers are often Ruby wrappers around shell commands, and can be short and easy to create.

### plugin

A **plugin** is a custom [type](#type), [function](#function), or [fact](#fact) that extends Puppet's capabilities and is distributed via a [module](#module). See [Plugins in Modules](/guides/plugins_in_modules.html) for more details.

### Puppet

"**Puppet**" can refer to several things:

* The Puppet suite of automation products.
* The open source Puppet project.
* The command you run to invoke the Puppet [agent](#agent) daemon on a [node](#node).
* The [Puppet language](#puppet-language) that you use you write [manifests](#manifest).

For general information about Puppet's architecture, see [the Puppet documentation](/puppet/latest/reference/architecture.html).

### PuppetDB

**PuppetDB** is an open-source database that caches and stores data generated by Puppet. This makes Puppet work faster and provides an API for other applications to access Puppet's collected data. It also enables advanced Puppet features, such as [exported resources](#exported-resource). For more information about PuppetDB, see [its documentation](/puppetdb/latest/).

### Puppet Collection

A **Puppet Collection** is a package repository that contains versions of open-source Puppet components designed to work together. Puppet Collections were introduced with Puppet 4. For more information, see the [Puppet Collection documentation](/puppet/latest/reference/puppet_collections.html).

### Puppet Enterprise

**Puppet Enterprise** is the best-of-breed distribution for the Puppet family of systems automation tools. It includes several unique tools designed to manage Puppet across thousands of [nodes](#node), such as the [console](#console), [Node Manager](#node-manager), [Configuration Manager](#configuration-manager), [r10k](#r10k), and [Razor](#razor). For more information, see [the Puppet Enterprise documentation](/pe/).

### Puppet language

You write Puppet code in the **Puppet language**. Puppet language files are called [manifests](#manifest) and are named with the `.pp` extension. The Puppet [master](#master) [compiles](#compilation) this Puppet code into a [catalog](#catalog) during a [Puppet run](#puppet-run). For a summary of the Puppet language, see the [Basics](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_summary.html) page in its reference.

### Puppet run

A **Puppet run** is when a Puppet [agent](#agent) sends [facts](#fact) and an identifying certificate to a Puppet [master](#master), and requests a [compiled](#compilation) [catalog](#catalog) in return. The agent applies that catalog to the [node](#node) by using operating system-specific [providers](#provider) to bring the node's [properties](#property) in line with the catalog's definitions, then sends a [report](#report) of logs and metrics to the Puppet master.

By default, a Puppet run takes place every 30 minutes, even when an agent's catalog or configuration haven't changed. For a detailed description of a Puppet run, see the [Agent/Master HTTPS Communications](/puppet/latest/reference/subsystem_agent_master_comm.html) page of the Puppet documentation.

### Puppet Server

**Puppet Server** is an open-source Java Virtual machine application that provides high-performance, scalable Puppet [master](#master) services and an administrative API for maintenance. For more information, see [the Puppet Server documentation](/puppetserver/latest/services_master_puppetserver.html).

### Puppetfile

A **Puppetfile** is an authoritative, standalone list that specifies to [r10k](#r10k) which [modules](#module) to install, what versions to install, and which source to use. This lets you quickly install sets of modules. For more information, see [Managing Modules with the Puppetfile](/pe/latest/r10k_puppetfile.html).

### puppetize

A **puppetized** [node](#node), [resource](#resource), or [property](#property) is one that Puppet manages.

### r10k

The **r10k** tool in [Puppet Enterprise](#puppet-enterprise) helps you manage [Puppet code](#puppet-language) in [environments](#environment) and [modules](#module) by using [Puppetfiles](#puppetfile). For more information, see the [Getting to Know r10k](/pe/latest/r10k.html) guide.

### Razor

**Razor** is a [Puppet Enterprise](#puppet-enterprise) provisioning application designed to help you discover, configure, and deploy bare-metal hardware, even if it doesn't yet have an operating system. For more information, see [the Razor documentation](/pe/latest/razor_intro.html).

### realize

To specify that a [virtual resource](#virtual-resource) should be applied to the current system, it must be **realized**. After you [declare](#declare) a virtual resource, there are two methods for realizing it:

1. Use the "spaceship" syntax (`<||>`).
2. Use the `realize` [function](#function).

A virtually declared resource is present in the [catalog](#catalog) but won't be applied to a system until it is realized. For more information, see the [Virtual Resources](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_virtual.html) page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) documentation.

### refresh

A [resource](#resource) is **refreshed** when a resource it [subscribes to](#subscribe) (or which [notifies it](#notify)) is modified.

Different resource types do different things when they're refreshed. For instance, services restart, mount points unmount and remount, and `exec`s execute if the `refreshonly` [attribute](#attribute) is set.

### relationship

A rule that sets the order in which [resources](#resource) should be managed creates a **relationship** between those resources. For more information, see the [Relationships and Ordering][] page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### report

You can configure Puppet [agents](#agent) to send **reports** containing logs and metrics at the end of every [Puppet run](#puppet-run). A [report processor](#report-processor) can transform those reports to a different format and send it to another application, location, or service.

For more information, see the [Reporting](/guides/reporting.html) guide. For details on the report format, see the [Reports](/puppet/latest/reference/format_report.html) format reference in the Puppet documentation.

### report processor

A **report processor** can take a Puppet [report](#report), transform it to a specific format, and send it to another application, location, or service. Puppet ships with [built-in report processors](/puppet/latest/reference/report.html), and you can [write your own](/guides/reporting.html#writing-custom-reports). For more information, see the [Reporting](/guides/reporting.html) guide.

### resource

A **resource** is a unit of configuration whose state can be managed by Puppet. Every resource has a [type](#type) (such as `file`, `service`, or `user`), a [title](#title), and one or more [attributes](#attribute) with specified [values](#value).

Resources can be large or small, and simple or complex. They do not always directly map to simple details on the client --- they might involve spreading information across multiple files or modifying devices. For example, a `service` resource only models a single service, but might involve executing an init script, running an external command to check its status, and modifying the system's run level configuration.

For more information about resources, see the [Resource](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_resources.html) page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### resource declaration

A **resource declaration** is a fragment of [Puppet code](#puppet-language) that details the desired state of a [resource](#resource) and instructs Puppet to manage it. This term helps to differentiate between the literal resource on a system and the specification for how to manage that resource. However, resource declarations are often referred to simply as "resources."

### role

A **role** defines the business purpose that a [node](#node) performs. A role typically consists of one [class](#class) that can completely configure categories of nodes with [profiles](#profile). A node shouldn't have more than one role; if a node requires more than one existing role, you should create a new role for it. See also [role and profile modules](#role-and-profile-module).

For more information about roles and profiles, see [the Puppet Enterprise documentation](/pe/latest/puppet_assign_configurations.html#assigning-configuration-data-with-role-and-profile-modules).

### role and profile module

A **role and profile module** is a Puppet [module](#module) that assigns configuration data to groups of [nodes](#node) based on [roles](#role) and [profiles](#profile). A role and profile module doesn't have any special features; it simply represents an abstract, private, [site-specific](#site) way to use modules to configure technology stacks and node descriptions.

For more information about roles and profiles, see [the Puppet Enterprise documentation](/pe/latest/puppet_assign_configurations.html#assigning-configuration-data-with-role-and-profile-modules).

### scope

(or **variable scope**; includes **local scope**, **node scope**, and **top scope**)

The **scope** refers to an area of [Puppet code](#puppet-language) that is partially isolated from other areas of code. Scopes limit the reach of [variables](#variable) and resource defaults. Scopes can be named (such as scopes created by class definitions) or anonymous (such as scopes created by [lambdas](#lambda) and [defined resources](#type-defined)).

In general, if multiple variables with the same name are available, Puppet uses the variable from the most local scope.

![An Euler diagram of several scopes. Top scope contains node scope, which contains the example::other, example::four, and example::parent scopes. Example::parent contains the example::child scope.][/puppet/latest/reference/images/scope-euler-diagram.png]

The three most common scopes you'll work with in the Puppet language are:

* **Top scope,** from which variables are accessible from anywhere by their short name (such as `$my_variable`) but can be overridden in a local scope. The top scope's name is always an empty string, and top-scope variables can always be accessed using the double-colon namespace separator with an empty string (`$::my_variable`).
* **Node scope,** a special scope created in a [node definition](#node-definition). You can refer to a node-scope variable from anywhere within a node scope by its short name, and node-scope variables can override top-scope variables.
* **Local scope,** where you can refer to a variable by its short name inside that scope and the scope's children, but typically cannot access it from other scopes.

There are a few exceptions, and you might also encounter other, more situational scopes. For detailed information, see the [Scope](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_scope.html) page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

> **Note:** Previously, Puppet used dynamic scope, which would search for short-named variables through a long chain of parent scopes. This scope was deprecated in Puppet 2.7, and in Puppet 4 is used only for resource defaults.

### singleton

A **singleton** is an object in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language), such as a [class](#class), that can only be evaluated once. For example, you can't have more than one distinct class with the same specific [name](#namevar) in a [manifest](#manifest) or [catalog](#catalog), making that class a singleton.

### site

A **site** refers to an entire IT ecosystem that is managed by Puppet. A site includes all Puppet [master](#master) servers, [agent nodes](#agent), and independent masterless Puppet [nodes](#node) within an organization.

### site module

A **site module** is a common Puppet idiom in which one or more [modules](#module) contain [classes](#class) specific to a given Puppet [site](#site). These classes usually describe complete configurations for a specific system or group of systems. For example, the `site::db_slave` class might describe the entire configuration of a database server, and a new database server could be configured simply by applying that class to it.

### subclass

A **subclass** is a [class](#class) that inherits from another class. See [inheritance](#inheritance-class).

### subscribe

A notification [relationship](#relationship) set with the `subscribe` [metaparameter](#metaparameter), or the wavy [chaining arrow](#chaining-arrow) (`~>`), is referred to as a **subscription**. For more information, see the [Relationships and Ordering][] page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### template

A **template** is a partial document that is filled in with data from [variables](#variable). Puppet can use Embedded Puppet (EPP) written in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language), or Embedded Ruby (ERB) templates written in Ruby, to generate configuration files tailored to an individual system. For more information, see the [Using Templates](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_template.html) page in the Puppet language reference.

### title

A **title** is the unique identifier of a [resource](#resource) or [class](#class) in a given Puppet [catalog](#catalog).

* In a class, the title is simply the class's [name](#namevar).
* In a resource [declaration](#declare), the title is the part after the first curly brace and before the colon; in the example below, the title is `/etc/passwd`:

~~~ ruby
file  { '/etc/passwd':
  owner => 'root',
  group => 'root',
}
~~~

* In native resource types, the name or [namevar](#namevar) uses the title as its default [value](#value) if you don't explicitly specify a name.
* In a [defined type](#type-defined) or a class, the title is available for use throughout the [definition](#define) as the `$title` [variable](#variable).

Unlike the name or namevar, a resource's title doesn't need to map to any [attribute](#attribute) of the target system; it is only a referent. You can give a resource a single title even if its name must vary across different kinds of systems, like a configuration file whose location differs on Solaris.

For more information on resource titles, see [the Resources page](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_resources.html#syntax) in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.

### top scope

See [scope](#scope).

### type

A kind of [resource](#resource) that Puppet is able to manage; for example, `file`, `cron`, and `service` are all resource types. A type specifies the set of attributes that a resource of that type may use, and models the behavior of that kind of resource on the target system. You can declare many resources of a given type.

Puppet ships with a set of built-in resource types; see the [type reference](/puppet/latest/reference/type.html) for a complete list of them. New [native types](#type-native) can be added as [plugins](#plugin), and [defined types](#type-defined) can be constructed by grouping together resources of existing types.

Contrast with [data type](#type-data). See also [defined type](#type-defined) and [native type](#type-native).

### type (data)

(or **data type**; includes **abstract data type** and **core data type**)

Every [value](#value) has a **data type**, which is a named classification of a type of data that a [variable](#variable) or [parameter](#parameter) can hold. The [Puppet language](#puppet-language) has core data types (such as integer, Boolean, or string) and abstract data types (such as any or optional). For more information, see [About Values and Data Types](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_data.html) in the Puppet language reference.

### type (defined)

(or **defined type**, or **defined resource type;** sometimes called a **define** or **definition**)

A **defined type** is a [resource type](#type) [defined](#define) as a group of other [resources](#resource), written in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) and saved in a [manifest](#manifest). For example, a defined type could use a combination of `file` and `exec` resources to configure and populate a git repository.

Once you define a type, new resources of that type can be [declared](#declare) just like any native or custom resource; these are called **defined resources**.

Since defined types are written in the Puppet language instead of as Ruby plugins, they are analogous to macros in other languages. Contrast with [native types](#type-native). For more information, see [the Learning Puppet chapter on defined types](/learning/definedtypes.html) and the [Defined Resource Types](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_defined_types.html) page of the Puppet language reference.

### type (native)

(or **native type**, or **native resource type**)

A **native type** is a [resource](#resource) type written in Ruby. Puppet ships with a large set of built-in native types, and custom native types can be distributed as [plugins](#plugin) in [modules](#module). For a complete list of built-in types, see the [type reference](/puppet/latest/reference/type.html).

Native types have lower-level access to the target system than [defined types](#type-defined) and can use the system's own tools to make changes. Most native types have one or more [providers](#provider) that can implement the same resources on different kinds of systems.

### value

In the [Puppet language](#puppet-language), a **value** is a piece of data which has a certain [data type](#type-data), or in some cases represents a literal data type. You can assign values to [variables](#variable) and [parameters](#parameter). For more information about values and data types, see [About Values and Data Types](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_data.html) in the Puppet language reference.

### variable

A **variable** is a named placeholder in a [manifest](#manifest) that represents a [value](#value). Once assigned, variables cannot be reassigned within the same [scope](#scope); however, other scopes might be able to assign their own value to any variable name.

Variables in Puppet are indicated with a dollar sign (`$operatingsystem`, also known as a short name) and assigned with the equals sign (`$operatingsystem = "Debian"`). In certain scopes, variables can also be accessed using a qualified name consisting of the scope name, followed by a double-colon namespace separator, then the variable name; this pattern can be repeated to drill down through multiple scopes. (For example, `$apache::params::confdir` represents the `confdir` variable in the `params` subclass of the `apache` class.)

[Facts](#fact) from [agents](#agent) are represented as variables within Puppet manifests, and are automatically pre-assigned before [compilation](#compilation) begins. There are also [several other special pre-assigned variables](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars.html).

### variable scoping

See [scope](#scope).

### virtual resource

A **virtual resource** is a [resource](#resource) that is [declared](#declare) in the [catalog](#catalog) but isn't be applied to a system unless it is explicitly [realized](#realize).

For more information, see the [Virtual Resources](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_virtual.html) page in the [Puppet language](#puppet-language) reference.
