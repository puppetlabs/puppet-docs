### Windows: Execution policy restrictions

In some Windows installations, trying to run the `pdk` command causes errors related to execution policy restrictions.

To fix this issue, set your script execution policy to at least [RemoteSigned](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.1/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy) by running `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

Alternatively, you can change the `Scope` parameter of the `ExecutionPolicy` to the current session only by running `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

For more information about PowerShell execution policies and how to change them, see Microsoft documentation [about_Execution_Policies](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170).
