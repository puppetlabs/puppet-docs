Hiera is a key/value lookup tool for configuration data. Hiera makes Puppet better by keeping site-specific data out of your manifests. Puppet classes can request whatever data they need, and your Hiera data will act like a site-wide config file.

## Current Versions

* [Hiera 3.0](/hiera/3.0/) is included with open source Puppet versions 4.2 and up.
* [Hiera 1.0](/hiera/1/index.html) is compatible with Puppet 3.x and is included in Puppet Enterprise 3.x.


## Older Versions

* [Hiera 2.0](/hiera/2.0/index.html) is included with open source Puppet versions 4.0 through 4.1.
