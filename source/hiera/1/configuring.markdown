Hiera's config file is usually referred to as `hiera.yaml`. Use this file to configure the [hierarchy][], which backend(s) to use, and settings for each backend.

Hiera will fail with an error if the config file can't be found, although an empty config file is allowed.

Location
-----

Hiera uses different config file locations depending on how it was invoked.

### From Puppet

By default, the config file is `$confdir/hiera.yaml`, which is usually one of the following:

* `/etc/puppet/hiera.yaml` in \*nix open source Puppet
* `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml` in \*nix Puppet Enterprise
* [`COMMON_APPDATA`][common_appdata]`\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc\hiera.yaml` on Windows

In Puppet 3 or later, you can specify a different config file with [the `hiera_config` setting](/references/latest/configuration.html#hieraconfig) in `puppet.conf`. In Puppet 2.x, you cannot specify a different config file, although you can make `$confdir/hiera.yaml` a symlink to a different file.

### From the Command Line

* `/etc/hiera.yaml` on \*nix
* [`COMMON_APPDATA`][common_appdata]`\PuppetLabs\hiera\etc\hiera.yaml` on Windows

You can specify a different config file with the `-c` (`--config`) option.

### From Ruby Code

* `/etc/hiera.yaml` on \*nix
* [`COMMON_APPDATA`][common_appdata]`\PuppetLabs\hiera\etc\hiera.yaml` on Windows

You can specify a different config file or a hash of settings when calling `Hiera.new`.

Format
-----

Hiera's config file must be a [YAML][] hash. The file must be valid YAML, but may contain no data.

Each top-level key in the hash **must be a Ruby symbol with a colon (`:`) prefix.** The available settings are listed below, under ["Global Settings"](#global-settings) and ["Backend-Specific Settings"](#backend-specific-settings).

### Example Config File

[example]: #example-config-file

{% highlight yaml %}
---
:backends:
  - yaml
  - json
:yaml:
  :datadir: /etc/puppet/hieradata
:json:
  :datadir: /etc/puppet/hieradata
:hierarchy:
  - "%{::clientcert}"
  - "%{::custom_location}"
  - common
{% endhighlight %}

### Default Config Values

If the config file exists but has no data, the default settings will be equivalent to the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
:backends: yaml
:yaml:
  :datadir: /var/lib/hiera
:hierarchy: common
:logger: console
{% endhighlight %}

Global Settings
-----

The Hiera config file may contain any the following settings. If absent, they will have default values. **Note that each setting must be a Ruby symbol with a colon (`:`) prefix.**

### `:hierarchy`

Must be a **string** or an **array of strings,** where each string is the name of a static or dynamic data source. (A dynamic source is simply one that contains a `%{variable}` interpolation token. [See "Creating Hierarchies" for more details][hierarchy].)

The data sources in the hierarchy are checked in order, top to bottom.

**Default value:** `"common"` (i.e. a single-element hierarchy whose only level is named "common.")

### `:backends`

Must be a **string** or an **array of strings,** where each string is the name of an available Hiera backend. The built-in backends are `yaml` and `json`; an additional `puppet` backend is available when using Hiera with Puppet. Additional backends are available as add-ons.

> **Custom backends:** See ["Writing Custom Backends"][custom_backends] for details on writing new backend. Custom backends can interface with nearly any existing data store.

The list of backends is processed in order: in the [example above][example], Hiera would check the entire hierarchy in the **yaml** backend before starting again with the **json** backend.

**Default value:** `"yaml"`

### `:logger`

Must be the name of an available logger, as a **string.**

Loggers only control where warnings and debug messages are routed. You can use one of the built-in loggers, or write your own. The built-in loggers are:

* `console` (messages go directly to STDERR)
* `puppet` (messages go to Puppet's logging system)
* `noop` (messages are silenced)

> **Custom loggers:** You can make your own logger by providing a class called, e.g., `Hiera::Foo_logger` (in which case Hiera's internal name for the logger would be `foo`), and giving it class methods called `warn` and `debug`, each of which should accept a single string.

**Default value:** `"console"`; note that Puppet overrides this and sets it to `"puppet"`, regardless of what's in the config file.

### `:merge_behavior`

Must be one of the following:

* `native` (default) --- merge top-level keys only.
* `deep` --- merge recursively; in the event of conflicting keys, allow **lower priority** values to win. You almost never want this.
* `deeper` --- merge recursively; in the event of a conflict, allow **higher priority** values to win.

Anything but `native` requires the `deep_merge` Ruby gem to be installed.

Which merge strategy to use when doing a [hash merge lookup](./lookup_types.html#hash-merge). See ["Deep Merging in Hiera â‰¥ 1.2.0"](./lookup_types.html#deep-merging-in-hiera--120) for more details.

Backend-Specific Settings
-----

Any backend can define its own settings and read them from Hiera's config file. If present, the value of a given backend's key must be a **hash,** whose keys are the settings it uses.

The following settings are available for the built-in backends:

### `:yaml` and `:json`

#### `:datadir`

The directory in which to find data source files.

You can [interpolate variables][interpolate] into the datadir using `%{variable}` interpolation tokens. This allows you to, for example, point it at `/etc/puppet/hieradata/%{::environment}` to keep your production and development data entirely separate.

**Default value:** `/var/lib/hiera` on \*nix, and [`COMMON_APPDATA`][common_appdata]`\PuppetLabs\Hiera\var` on Windows.

### `:puppet`

#### `:datasource`

The Puppet class in which to look for data.

**Default value:** `data`
