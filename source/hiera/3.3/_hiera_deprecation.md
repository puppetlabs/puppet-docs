> ### **Important:** This is old documentation; read the new version instead.

> Puppet 4.9 and later use Hiera 5, and its documentation is in the Puppet reference manual. See the following pages for more info:
>
> * [What is Hiera? How do hierarchies and layers work?](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/hiera_intro.html)
> * [Migrating existing Hiera configurations to Hiera 5](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/hiera_migrate.html)
> * [Automatic class parameter lookup](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/hiera_automatic.html)

> We are preserving this Hiera 3 documentation for historical reference, but the Hiera 5 documentation is a complete replacement for it.
