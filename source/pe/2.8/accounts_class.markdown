---

This class is part of `pe_accounts`, a pre-built Puppet module included with Puppet Enterprise.

> ![windows-only](./images/windows-logo-small.jpg) **NOTE:**  `pe_accounts`  is not yet supported on Windows nodes.

The `pe_accounts` class can do any or all of the following:

- Create and manage a set of `pe_accounts::user` resources
- Create and manage a set of shared `group` resources
- Maintain a pair of rules in the `sudoers` file to grant privileges to the `sudo` and `sudonopw` groups

This class is designed for cases where your account data is **maintained separately** from your Puppet manifests. This usually means one of the following is true:

* The data is being read from a non-Puppet directory service or CMDB, probably with a custom function.
* The data is being maintained manually by a user who does not write Puppet code.
* The data is being generated by an out-of-band process.

If your site's account data will be maintained manually by a sysadmin able to write Puppet code, it will make more sense to maintain it as a normal set of `pe_accounts::user` and `group` resources, although you may still wish to use the `pe_accounts` class to maintain `sudoers` rules. 

To manage users and groups with the `pe_accounts` class, you **must** prepare a data store and configure the class for the data store when you declare it. 

**Note:** In Puppet Enterprise 1.2, this class was called `accounts`; it was renamed in PE 2 to avoid namespace conflicts. If you are upgrading and wish to continue using the older name, the upgrader can install a wrapper module to enable it. See [the chapter on upgrading](./install_upgrading.html) for more details. 

**Note:** In Puppet Enterprise 2.0 and higher, this class is assigned to the console's default group with no parameters, which will prevent it from being redeclared with any configuration. To use the class, you must:

* Unassign it from the default group in the console
* Create a wrapper module that declares this class with the necessary parameters
* Re-assign the wrapper class to whichever nodes need it

Usage Example
-----

To use YAML files as a data store: 

~~~ ruby
    class {'pe_accounts':
      data_store => yaml,
    }
~~~

To use a Puppet class as a data store (and manage `sudoers` rules):

~~~ ruby
    class {'pe_accounts':
      data_store     => namespace,
      data_namespace => 'site::pe_accounts::data',
      manage_sudoers => true,
    }
~~~

To manage `sudoers` rules without managing any users or groups:

~~~ ruby
    class {'pe_accounts':
      manage_users   => false,
      manage_groups  => false,
      manage_sudoers => true,
    }
~~~

Data Stores
-----

Account data can come from one of two sources: **a Puppet class that declares three variables,** or **a set of three [YAML](http://yaml.org/) files** stored in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/data`.

### Using a Puppet Class as a Data Store

This option is most useful if you are able to generate or import your user data with a [custom function](/guides/custom_functions.html), which may be querying from an LDAP directory or some other data source.

The Puppet class containing the data **must have a name ending in `::data`.** (We recommend `site::pe_accounts::data`.) This class must declare the following variables: 

- `$users_hash` should be a hash in which each key is the **title of a `pe_accounts::user` resource** and each value is **a hash containing that resource's attributes and values.**
- `$groups_hash` should be a hash in which each key is the **title of a group** and each value is **a hash containing that resource's attributes and values.**

[See below][dataformat] for examples of the data formats used in these variables.

When declaring the `pe_accounts` class to use data in a Puppet class, use the following attributes: 

    data_store     => namespace,
    data_namespace => {name of class},

### Using YAML Files as a Data Store

This option is most useful if your user data is being generated by an out-of-band process or is being maintained by a user who does not write Puppet manifests.

When storing data in YAML, the following valid [YAML](http://yaml.org/) files must exist in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/data`:

- `pe_accounts_users_hash.yaml`, which should contain an anonymous hash in which each key is the **title of a `pe_accounts::user` resource** and each value is **a hash containing that resource's attributes and values.**
- `pe_accounts_groups_hash.yaml`, which should contain an anonymous hash in which each key is the **title of a group** and each value is **a hash containing that resource's attributes and values.**

[See below][dataformat] for examples of the data formats used in these variables.

When declaring the `pe_accounts` class to use data in YAML files, use the following attribute: 

    data_store => yaml,

### Data Formats

[dataformat]: #data-formats

This class uses three hashes of data to construct the `pe_accounts::user` and `group` resources it manages. 

#### The Users Hash

The **users hash** represents a set of `pe_accounts::user` resources. Each key should be the **title of a `pe_accounts::user` resource,** and each value should be **another hash containing that resource's attributes and values.** 

##### Puppet Example

~~~ ruby
    $users_hash = {
      sysop => {
        locked  => false,
        comment => 'System Operator',
        uid     => '700',
        gid     => '700',
        groups  => ['admin', 'sudonopw'],
        sshkeys => ['ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAwLBhQefRiXHSbVNZYKu2o8VWJjZJ/B4LqICXuxhiiNSCmL8j+5zE/VLPIMeDqNQt8LjKJVOQGZtNutW4OhsLKxdgjzlYnfTsQHp8+JMAOFE3BD1spVnGdmJ33JdMsQ/fjrVMacaHyHK0jW4pHDeUU3kRgaGHtX4TnC0A175BNTH9yJliDvddRzdKR4WtokNzqJU3VPtHaGmJfXEYSfun/wFfc46+hP6u0WcSS7jZ2WElBZ7gNO4u2Z+eJjFWS9rjQ/gNE8HHlvmN0IUuvdpKdBlJjzSiKZR+r/Bo9ujQmGY4cmvlvgmcdajM/X1TqP6p3OuouAk5QSPUlDRV91oEHw== sysop+moduledevkey@puppetlabs.com'],

#### The Groups Hash

The **groups hash** represents a set of shared `group` resources. Each key should be the **title of a `group` resource,** and each value should be **another hash containing that resource's attributes and values.**

##### Puppet Example

~~~ ruby
    $groups_hash = {
      developer => {
        gid    => 3003,
        ensure => present,
      },
      sudonopw => {
        gid    => 3002,
        ensure => present,
      },
      sudo     => {
        gid    => 3001,
        ensure => present,
      },
      admin    => {
        gid    => 3000,
        ensure => present,
      },
    }
~~~

##### YAML Example

    ---
    developer:
     gid: "3003"
     ensure: "present"
    sudonopw:
     gid: "3002"
     ensure: "present"
    sudo:
     gid: "3001"
     ensure: "present"
    admin:
     gid: "3000"
     ensure: "present"

Parameters
-----

### `manage_groups`

Specifies whether or not to manage a set of shared groups, which can be used by all `pe_accounts::user` resources. If true, your data store must define these groups in the `$groups_hash` variable or the `pe_accounts_groups_hash.yaml` file. Allowed values are `true` and `false`; defaults to `true`.

### `manage_users`

Specifies whether or not to manage a set of `pe_accounts::user` resources. If true, your data store must define these users in the `$users_hash` variable or the `pe_accounts_users_hash.yaml` file. Allowed values are `true` and `false`; defaults to `true`.

### `manage_sudoers`

Specifies whether or not to add sudo rules to the node's `sudoers` file. If true, the class will add  `%sudo` and `%sudonopw` groups to the `sudoers` file and give them full sudo and passwordless sudo privileges respectively. You will need to make sure that the `sudo` and `sudonopw` groups exist in the groups hash, and that your chosen users have those groups in their `groups` arrays. Managing `sudoers` is not supported on Solaris.

Allowed values are `true` and `false`; defaults to `false`.

### `data_store`

Specifies the data store to use for accounts and groups.

When set to `namespace`, data will be read from the puppet class specified in the `data_namespace` parameter.  When set to `yaml`, data will be read from specially-named YAML files in the `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/data` directory. (If you have changed your `$confdir`, it will look in `$confdir/data`.) Example YAML files are provided in the `ext/data/` directory of this module.

Allowed values are `yaml` and `namespace`; defaults to `namespace`.

### `data_namespace`

Specifies the Puppet namespace from which to read data. This must be the name of a Puppet class, and must end with `::data` (we recommend using `site::pe_accounts::data`); the class will automatically be declared by the `pe_accounts` class. The class cannot have any parameters, and must declare variables named:

- `$users_hash`
- `$groups_hash`

See the `pe_accounts::data` class included in this module (in `manifests/data.pp`) for an example; see [the data formats section](#data-formats) for information on each hash's data structure. 

Defaults to `pe_accounts::data`.

### `sudoers_path`

Specifies the path to the `sudoers` file on this system. Defaults to `/etc/sudoers`.
