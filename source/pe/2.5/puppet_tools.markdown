Puppet is built on a large number of services and command-line tools. Understanding which to reach for and when is crucial to using Puppet effectively.

You can read more about any of these tools by running `puppet man <SUBCOMMAND>` at the command line. 

Fundamental Services
-----

Puppet agent and puppet master are the heart of Puppet's architecture.

* The puppet agent service runs on every managed Puppet Enterprise node. It fetches and applies configurations from a puppet master server every 30 minutes. 

    In Puppet Enterprise, puppet agent runs without user interaction as the `pe-puppet` service. You can manually trigger an immediate run from a node's command line by running `sudo puppet agent --test`. You can also trigger agent runs using the [Control Puppet](./console_live_puppet.html) tab of the console's live management page.
    
    Puppet agent reads its settings from the `[main]` and `[agent]` blocks of `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`.
* The puppet master service compiles and serves configurations to agent nodes.
    
    In Puppet Enterprise, puppet master is managed by Apache and Passenger, under the umbrella of the `pe-httpd` service. 
    
    The puppet master creates agent configurations by consulting its Puppet modules and the instructions it receives from the [console](./console_accessing.html). 

    The puppet master reads its settings from the `[main]` and `[master]` blocks of `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`. It can also be configured conditionally by using [environments](/guides/environment.html).

Everyday Tools
-----

* The puppet cert subcommand is used to add nodes to your puppet deployment. 
    
    After a new agent node has been installed, it cannot fetch configurations until its certificate request has been approved. Run `puppet cert list` on the puppet master to see which certificate requests are still outstanding, and run `puppet cert sign <NODE>` to approve a request. 
    
    When you decommission a node and remove it from your infrastructure, you should destroy its certificate information by running `puppet cert clean <NODE>` on the puppet master. 
* The puppet apply subcommand can compile and apply Puppet manifests without the need for a puppet master. It's ideal for testing new modules (`puppet apply -e 'include <CLASS NAME>'`), but can also be used to manage an entire Puppet deployment in a masterless arrangement. 
* The puppet resource subcommand provides an interactive shell for manipulating Puppet's underlying resource framework. It is ideal for one-off administration tasks and ad-hoc management, and offers an abstraction layer between various OSs' implementations of core functionality. 
    
        $ sudo puppet resource package nano ensure=latest
        notice: /Package[nano]/ensure: created
        package { 'nano':
          ensure => '1.3.12-1.1',
        }
