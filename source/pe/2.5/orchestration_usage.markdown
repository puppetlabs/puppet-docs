Running Actions
-----

Orchestration actions are grouped and distributed as MCollective
plugins. In the default installation of Puppet Enterprise, you can run any orchestration action from any plugin while logged in as the `peadmin` user on the puppet master node.

To open a shell as the `peadmin` user, run:

    $ sudo -i -u peadmin

To run orchestration actions, use the `mco` command:

    $ mco <PLUGIN> <FILTER> <ACTION> <ARGUMENT> <OPTIONS>

Available Actions
-----

The following orchestration actions are available in PE 2.0:

* `rpcutil` plugin
  - `find` action returns a list of all nodes matching a search filter
  - `ping` action returns a list of all nodes and their latencies
  - `inventory` action returns a list of Facts, Classes, and other information from all nodes
  - this plugin's actions are exposed via higher-level wrappers, such as the `mco ping` command
* `puppetral` plugin
  - `find` action returns a Puppet resource of a given type and title and its variations across all nodes
  - `search` action returns all Puppet resources of a given type across all nodes
  - `create` action creates a given resource across all nodes
    - creating an exec resource allows for arbitrary management of nodes
* `puppetd` plugin
  - `enable` and `disable` actions will enable and disable puppet agent on a node or nodes
  - `runonce` action initiates a puppet agent run on all nodes
  - `last_run_summary` action retrieves the most recent Puppet run summary from all nodes
  - `status` action returns puppet agent's run status on all nodes
* `service` plugin
  - `start, stop, restart,` and `status` actions allow direct management of services across the deployment
* `package` plugin
  - `install, purge, checkupdate, update,` and `status` actions work through the system package manager to query and ensure the state of software packages across the deployment
* `controller` plugin
  - `stats` action returns cumulative statistics about MCollective messages passed between nodes
  - `reload_agent` action refreshes from disk the code for a specific plugin
  - `reload_agents` action refreshes from disk the code for all plugins
  - `exit` action removes nodes from the MCollective network

Filtering Nodes
-----

Most orchestration actions in Puppet Enterprise 2.5 can be executed
on a set of nodes determined by meta-data about the deployment.
This filtering provides a much more convenient way to manage nodes
than the traditional approach of using host names or fully
qualified domain names to identify and access machines. Node sets
can be created by filtering based on Facter facts, Puppet classes,
and host names. Filters can be specified by passing options to the
`mco` command. For example:

    $ mco find --with-fact osfamily=RedHat

This command forces the find action to only return nodes which have a
fact named osfamily with a value of RedHat.  Filter options are
case sensitive and support regular expression syntax.

Examples
-----

### Ping

The `ping` action of the rpcutil plugin is wrapped to be available at
a higher level than the `mco ping` command. This command returns a list
of all the nodes and their network latencies.  In a typical Puppet
Enterprise deployment, latencies for issuing an orchestration
action are less than half a second:

    peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco ping
    puppetmaster.example.com               time=135.94 ms
    agent.example.com                      time=136.55 ms
    ---- ping statistics ----
    2 replies max: 136.55 min: 135.94 avg: 136.25

### Find

The `find` action of the rpcutil plugin is wrapped to be available at
a higher level than the `mco find` command. This command returns a list
of all the nodes in the network:

    peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco find
    puppetmaster.example.com
    agent.example.com

### Inventory

The `inventory` action of the rpcutil plugin is wrapped to be
available at a higher level than the `mco inventory` command. This
command returns facts and classes, among other information:

    peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco inventory agent.example.com
    Inventory for agent.example.com:

### Puppetd

The puppetd plugin orchestrates Puppet itself across the
deployment. This plugin is capable of kicking off Puppet
configuration runs on each node in the deployment all at the same
time, on a subset of the deployment using filtering, or using a
maximum concurrency level. The maximum concurrency feature is
particularly noteworthy as it allows the execution of a
configuration run on all nodes in the population, but sets an upper
limit on the number of nodes that are performing their run at any
given time, thus mitigating the network load and resource demands
on the puppet master. This example performs a configuration run on
all nodes, but only one node at a time:

    peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco puppetd runall 1
    Tue Nov 15 11:17:11 -0800 2011> Running all machines with a concurrency of 1
    Tue Nov 15 11:17:11 -0800 2011> Discovering hosts to run
    Tue Nov 15 11:17:13 -0800 2011> Found 2 hosts
    Tue Nov 15 11:17:13 -0800 2011> Running agent.example.com, concurrency is 0
    Tue Nov 15 11:17:14 -0800 2011> agent.example.com schedule status: OK
    Tue Nov 15 11:17:15 -0800 2011> Currently 1 nodes running; waiting
    Tue Nov 15 11:17:21 -0800 2011> Running puppetmaster.example.com, concurrency is 0
    Tue Nov 15 11:17:22 -0800 2011> puppetmaster.example.com schedule status: OK
    Finished processing 1 / 1 hosts in 98.98 ms

Note, the "1 / 1 hosts" is an indication that one host was actually
performing the orchestration of the Puppet configuration run.  This
does not mean only one host in the deployment performed the
configuration run.  The message "Found 2 hosts" indicates that two
nodes carried out this action.

Once finished with the Puppet configuration run, the `status` action
can be used to see the last Puppet configuration run for each node
in the deployment.

    peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco puppetd status
    [ =============================================> ] 2 / 2
    agent.example.com  Enabled, not running, last run 10 seconds ago
    puppetmaster.example.com  Enabled, not running, last run 2 seconds ago

    Finished processing 2 / 2 hosts in 105.29 ms

### PuppetRAL

The puppetral plugin provides a command line tool to work with any
resource Puppet is capable of managing.  A common use case for the
puppetral plugin is to execute arbitrary commands on the deployment
using the exec resource. This example creates a new file on all
nodes in the deployment:

    peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco rpc puppetral \
    create type=exec title="/bin/bash -c 'echo Hello > /tmp/hello'"
    Determining the amount of hosts matching filter for 2 seconds .... 2

    [ =================================================> ] 2 / 2

    agent.example.com                      
    Status: Resource was created
    Resource:
      {"exported"=>false, 
       "title"=>"/bin/bash -c 'echo Hello > /tmp/hello'",
       "parameters"=>{:returns=>:notrun},
       "tags"=>["exec"],
       "type"=>"Exec"}

     puppetmaster.example.com              
     Status: Resource was created
     Resource:
       {"exported"=>false,
        "title"=>"/bin/bash -c 'echo Hello > /tmp/hello'",
        "parameters"=>{:returns=>:notrun},
        "tags"=>["exec"],
        "type"=>"Exec"}

     Finished processing 2 / 2 hosts in 249.21 ms

The creation of this file can be verified with the `find` action:

     peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco rpc puppetral find type=file title=/tmp/hello

     Determining the amount of hosts matching filter for 2 seconds .... 2

     [ ================================================> ] 2 / 2

     agent.example.com
       exported: false
       managed: false
       title: /tmp/hello
       parameters:
         {:ctime=>Tue Nov 15 11:32:10 -0800 2011,
          :type=>"file",
          :ensure=>:file,
          :group=>0,
          :owner=>0,
          :mtime=>Tue Nov 15 11:32:10 -0800 2011,
          :mode=>"644",
          :content=>"{md5}09f7e02f1290be211da707a266f153b3"}
      tags: ["file"]
      type: File

     puppetmaster.example.com
       managed: false
       exported: false
       title: /tmp/hello
       parameters:
         {:ctime=>Tue Nov 15 11:32:10 -0800 2011,
          :type=>"file",
          :group=>0,
          :ensure=>:file,
          :owner=>0,
          :mtime=>Tue Nov 15 11:32:10 -0800 2011,
          :mode=>"644",
          :content=>"{md5}09f7e02f1290be211da707a266f153b3"}
       tags: ["file"]
       type: File

     Finished processing 2 / 2 hosts in 166.12 ms

The puppetral plugin can manage any resource Puppet itself is
capable of managing. In particular, user, group, host, and
package resources are exposed directly in the console's live management page.

### Service

Puppet agent will automatically restart a service it manages when related
resources are changed, but sometimes services need to be restarted outside of a normal Puppet
configuration run. The `mco service` command can be used in these cases.
This example restarts the SSH daemon on all
nodes running RedHat:

    peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco service sshd restart -W osfamily=RedHat
    [ ==================================================> ] 2/ 2
    ---- service summary ----
    Nodes: 2 / 2
    Statuses: started=2
    Elapsed Time: 1.45 s

The status of the restarted services can be shown with:

    peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco service sshd status -W osfamily=RedHat
    [ ==================================================> ] 2 / 2
    puppetmaster.example.com               status=running
    agent.example.com                      status=running
    ---- service summary ----
    Nodes: 2 / 2
    Statuses: started=2
    Elapsed Time: 0.26 s

### Package

Similar to the service plugin, the `package` plugin manages software
packages outside of a normal Puppet configuration run. The
following is the trimmed output from running the
`checkupdates` action:

    peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco rpc package checkupdates -W fqdn=agent.example.com
    Determining the amount of hosts matching filter for 2 seconds .... 1
     * [ ============================================================> ] 1 / 1

### Controller

The `mco controller` command manages the underlying MCollective
infrastructure. This can be used to load plugins obtained outside
of Puppet Enterprise or custom written for the deployment. This
example reloads all plugins across the Puppet Enterprise
deployment:

     peadmin@puppetmaster:~$ mco controller reload_agents
     Determining the amount of hosts matching filter for 2 seconds .... 2
     agent.example.com> reloaded all agents
     puppetmaster.example.com> reloaded all agents
     Finished processing 2 / 2 hosts in 137.86 ms
