Hardware
-----

Puppet Enterprise's hardware requirements depend on the roles a machine performs. 

* The **puppet master** role should be installed on a robust, dedicated server.
    * Minimum requirements: 2 processor cores, 1 GB RAM, and very accurate timekeeping.
    * Recommended requirements: Physical hardware or Xen or KVM virtual server, with 2-4 processor cores and 4 GB RAM. Performance will vary, but this configuration can generally manage approximately 1,000 agent nodes. 
* The **console** role should usually be installed on the same server as the puppet master, but can optionally be separated.
    * Minimum requirements: A machine able to handle moderate web traffic and perform processor-intensive background tasks.<!-- TODO better requirements for lone console. -->
* The **cloud provisioner** role has very modest requirements.
    * Minimum requirements: A system which provides interactive shell access for trusted users.
* The **puppet agent** role has very modest requirements.
    * Minimum requirements: Any hardware able to comfortably run a supported operating system.
