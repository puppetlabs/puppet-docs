---

Answer files are used for automated installations of PE. See [the section on automated installation](./install_automated.html) for more details.

Answer File Syntax
------------------

Answer files consist of normal shell script variable assignments:

    q_database_port=3306

Boolean answers should use Y or N (case-insensitive) rather than true, false, 1, or 0.

A variable can be omitted if a prior answer ensures that it won't be used (i.e. `q_puppetmaster_certname` can be left blank if `q_puppetmaster_install` = n).

Answer files can include arbitrary bash control logic and can assign variables with commands in subshells (`$(command)`). For example, to set an agent node's certname to its fqdn:

    q_puppetagent_certname=$(hostname -f)

To set it to a UUID:

    q_puppetagent_certname=$(uuidgen)

Sample Answer Files
-------------------

PE includes a collection of sample answer files in the `answers` directory of your distribution tarball. A successful installation will also save an answer file called `answers.lastrun`, which can be used as a foundation for later installations. Finally, you can generate a new answer file without installing by running the installer with the `-s` option and a filename argument.

Installer Answers
-----

### Global Answers

These answers are always needed.

`q_install`
: **Y or N** --- Whether to install. Answer files must set this to Y.

`q_vendor_packages_install`
: **Y or N** --- Whether the installer has permission to install additional packages from the OS's repositories. If this is set to N, the installation will fail if the installer detects missing dependencies.

`q_run_updtvpkg`
: **Y or N** --- Only used on AIX. Whether to run the `updtvpkg` command to add info about native libraries to the RPM database. The answer should usually be Y, unless you have special needs around the RPM database.

### Roles

These answers are always needed.

`q_puppetmaster_install`
: **Y or N** --- Whether to install the puppet master role.

`q_puppetdb_install`
: **Y or N** --- Whether to install the database support (the console Postgres server and PuppetDB) role.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_install`
: **Y or N** --- Whether to install the console role.

`q_puppetagent_install`
: **Y or N** --- Whether to install the puppet agent role.

`q_puppet_cloud_install`
: **Y or N** --- Whether to install the cloud provisioner role.


### Puppet Agent Answers

These answers are always needed.

`q_puppetagent_certname`
: **String** --- An identifying string for this agent node. This per-node ID must be unique across your entire site. Fully qualified domain names are often used as agent certnames.

`q_puppetagent_server`
: **String** --- The hostname of the puppet master server. For the agent to trust the master's certificate, this must be one of the valid DNS names you chose when installing the puppet master.

`q_fail_on_unsuccessful_master_lookup`
: **Y or N** --- Whether to quit the install if the puppet master cannot be reached.

`q_skip_master_verification`
: **Y or N** --- This is a silent install option, default is N. When set to Y, the installer will skip master verification which allows the user to deploy agents when they know the master won't be available.

### Puppet Master Answers

These answers are generally needed if you are installing the puppet master role.

`q_all_in_one_install`
: **Y or N** --- Whether or not the installation is an all-in-one installation, (i.e., are puppetdb and the console also being installed on this node).

`q_puppetmaster_certname`
: **String** --- An identifying string for the puppet master. This ID must be unique across your entire site. The server's fully qualified domain name is often used as the puppet master's certname.

`q_puppetmaster_dnsaltnames`
: **String** --- Valid DNS names at which the puppet master can be reached. Must be a comma-separated list. In a normal installation, defaults to `<hostname>,<hostname.domain>,puppet,puppet.<domain>`.

`q_puppetmaster_enterpriseconsole_hostname`
: **String** --- The hostname of the server running the console role. Only needed if you are _not_ installing the console role on the puppet master server.

`q_puppetmaster_enterpriseconsole_port`
: **Integer** --- The port on which to contact the console server. Only needed if you are _not_ installing the console role on the puppet master server.

`q_pe_check_for_updates`
: **y or n; MUST BE LOWERCASE** --- Whether to check for updates whenever the `pe-httpd` service restarts. To get the correct update info, the server will pass some basic, anonymous info to Puppet Labs' servers. Specifically, it will transmit:

  * the IP address of the client
  * the type and version of the client's OS
  * the installed version of PE
  * the number of nodes licensed and the number of nodes used

  If you wish to disable update checks (e.g. if your company policy forbids transmitting this information), you will need to set this to `n`. You can also disable checking after installation by editing the `/etc/puppetlabs/installer/answers.install` file.

`q_tarball_server`
: **String** --- The location from which PE agent tarballs will be downloaded before installation. Note that agent tarballs are only available for certain operating systems. For details, see [the PE installation instructions](./install_basic.html)

: **Y or N** --- Whether to disable or enable live management in the console. Note that you need to manually add this question to your answer to file before an installation or upgrade.

`q_pe_database`

: **String** --- The hostname of the server running the master role. Only needed if you are _not_ installing the console role on the puppet master server.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_httpd_port`
: **Integer** --- The port on which to serve the console. The default is port 443, which will allow access to the console from a web browser without manually specifying a port. If port 443 is not available, the installer will try port 3000, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004, and 3005.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_auth_user_email`
: **String** --- The email address the console's admin user will use to log in.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_database_name`
: **String** --- The database the console will use. Note that if you are not installing the database support role, this database must already exist on the PostgreSQL server.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_database_user`
: **String** --- The PostgreSQL user the console will use. Note that if you are not installing the database support role, this user must already exist on the PostgreSQL server and must be able to edit the console's database.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_database_password`
: **String** --- The password for the console's PostgreSQL user.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_auth_database_name`
: **String** --- The database the console authentication will use. Note that if you are not installing the database support role, this database must already exist on the PostgreSQL server.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_auth_database_user`
