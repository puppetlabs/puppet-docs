**Modules** are self-contained bundles of code and data. You can download pre-built modules from [the Puppet Forge][forge] or you can write your own modules.

**Nearly all Puppet manifests belong in modules.** The sole exception is the main `site.pp` manifest, which contains site-wide and node-specific code.

Every Puppet user should expect to write at least some of their own modules.

## Using modules

Modules are how Puppet finds the classes and types it can use --- it automatically loads any [class][classes] or [defined type][defined_types] stored in its modules. Any of these classes or defines can be declared by name within a manifest or from an [external node classifier (ENC)][enc].

``` puppet
# /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp

node default {
  include apache

  class {'ntp':
    enable => false;
  }

  apache::vhost {'personal_site':
    port    => 80,
    docroot => '/var/www/personal',
    options => 'Indexes MultiViews',
  }
}
```

Likewise, Puppet can automatically load plugins (like custom native resource types or custom facts) from modules; see ["Using Plugins"][plugins] for more details.

To make a module available to Puppet, place it in one of the directories in Puppet's [modulepath][], and make sure it has a [valid name](#allowed-module-names).

You can easily install modules written by other users with the `puppet module` subcommand. [See "Installing Modules"][installing] for details.


## Module layout

On disk, a module is simply a directory tree with a specific, predictable structure:

* `<MODULE NAME>`
    * `manifests`
    * `files`
    * `templates`
    * `lib`
    * `facts.d`
    * `examples`
    * `spec`
    * `types`

> Note: As of Puppet 4.5, using [`puppet module generate`](#writing-modules) to create your module skeleton creates an `examples` directory instead of the deprecated `tests` directory.

### Example

This example module, `my_module`, shows the standard module layout in more detail:

* `my_module` --- This outermost directory's name matches the name of the module.
    * `manifests/` --- Contains all of the manifests in the module.
        * `init.pp` --- Contains a class definition. **This class's name must match the module's name.**
        * `other_class.pp` --- Contains a class named `my_module::other_class`.
        * `my_defined_type.pp` --- Contains a defined type named `my_module::my_defined_type`.
        * `implementation/` --- This directory's name affects the class names beneath it.
            * `foo.pp` --- Contains a class named `my_module::implementation::foo`.
            * `bar.pp` --- Contains a class named `my_module::implementation::bar`.
    * `files/` --- Contains static files, which managed nodes can download.
        * `service.conf` --- This file's `source =>` URL would be `puppet:///modules/my_module/service.conf`. Its contents can also be accessed with the `file` function, like `content => file('my_module/service.conf')`.
    * `lib/` --- Contains plugins, like [custom facts][] and custom resource types. These will be used by both the Puppet master server and the Puppet agent service, and they'll be synced to all agent nodes whenever they request their configurations. See ["Using Plugins"][plugins] for more details.
    * `facts.d/` --- Contains [external facts][], which are an alternative to Ruby-based [custom facts][]. These will be synced to all agent nodes, so they can submit values for those facts to the Puppet master. (Requires Facter 2.0.1 or later.)
    * `templates/` --- Contains templates, which the module's manifests can use. See ["Templates"][templates] for more details.
        * `component.erb` --- A manifest can render this template with `template('my_module/component.erb')`.
        * `component.epp` --- A manifest can render this template with `epp('my_module/component.epp')`.
    * `examples/` --- Contains examples showing how to declare the module's classes and defined types.
        * `init.pp`
        * `other_example.pp` --- Major use cases should have an example.
    * `spec/` --- Contains spec tests for any plugins in the lib directory.
    * `types/` --- Contains [data type alias][] definitions.
        * `foo.pp` --- Contains an alias called `MyModule::Foo`
        * `otherexample.pp` --- Contains an alias called `MyModule::OtherExample`

Each of the module's subdirectories has a specific function, as follows.

### Manifests

Each manifest in a module's `manifests` folder should contain one class or defined type. The file names of manifests map predictably to the names of the classes and defined types they contain.

`init.pp` is special and always contains a class with the same name as the module. You cannot have a class named `init`.

Every other manifest contains a class or defined type named as follows:

Name of module | :: | Other directories:: (if any) | Name of file (no extension)
---------------|----|------------------------------|----------------------------
 `my_module`   |`::`|                              | `other_class`
 `my_module`   |`::`|    `implementation::`        |     `foo`

Thus:

* `my_module::other_class` would be in the file `my_module/manifests/other_class.pp`
* `my_module::implementation::foo` would be in the file `my_module/manifests/implementation/foo.pp`

The double colon that divides the sections of a class's name is called the *namespace separator.*

### Allowed module names

Module names should only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, and should begin with a lowercase letter; that is, they should match the expression `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`. Note that these are the same restrictions that apply to class names, but with the added restriction that module names cannot contain the namespace separator (`::`) as modules cannot be nested.

Certain module names are disallowed; see the list of [reserved words and names][reserved names].

### Files

Files in a module's `files` directory can be served to agent nodes. They can be downloaded by using `puppet:///` URLs in the `source` attribute of a [`file`][file] resource.

You can also access module files with [the `file` function][file_function]. This function takes a `<MODULE NAME>/<FILE NAME>` reference and returns the content of the requested file from the module's `files` directory.

Puppet URLs work transparently in both agent/master mode and standalone mode; in either case, they will retrieve the correct file from a module.

[file]: ./type.html#file

Puppet URLs are formatted as follows:

 Protocol | 3 slashes | "Modules"/ | Name of module/ |  Name of file
----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|---------------
`puppet:` |   `///`   | `modules/` |   `my_module/`  | `service.conf`

So `puppet:///modules/my_module/service.conf` would map to `my_module/files/service.conf`.

### Templates

Any ERB or EPP template (see ["Templates"][templates] for more details) can be rendered in a manifest with the `template` function (for ERB templates which use Ruby) or the `epp` function (for EPP templates, which use the Puppet language). The output of the template is a string, which can be used as the content attribute of a [`file`][file] resource or as the value of a variable.

The `template` and `epp` functions can look up templates identified by shorthand:

Template function | (' | Name of module/ | Name of template | ')
------------------|----|-----------------|------------------|----
    `template`    |`('`|   `my_module/`  | `component.erb`  |`')`
    `epp`         |`('`|   `my_module/`  | `component.epp`  |`')`

So `template('my_module/component.erb')` would render the template `my_module/templates/component.erb`, and `epp('my_module/component.epp')` would render `my_module/templates/component.epp`.

## Writing modules

To write a module, we strongly suggest running `puppet module generate <USERNAME>-<MODULE NAME>`.

When you run the above command, the Puppet module tool (PMT) will ask a series of questions to gather metadata about your module, and creates a basic module structure for you.

```
$ puppet module generate examplecorp-mymodule

We need to create a metadata.json file for this module.  Please answer the
following questions; if the question is not applicable to this module, feel free
to leave it blank.

Puppet uses Semantic Versioning (semver.org) to version modules.

For help getting started writing your module, see the [Beginner's Guide to Modules](/guides/module_guides/bgtm.html).

You also have the option of writing classes and defined types by hand and placing them in properly named manifest files as [described in the "Module Layout" section above](#module-layout). If you take this route, you **must** ensure that your `metadata.json` file is properly formatted or your module **will not work**.

* [See here][classes] for more information on classes
* [See here][defined_types] for more information on defined types

## Tips

A module's [classes][], [defined types][defined_types], and [plugins][] **should all be related,** and the module should aim to be **as self-contained as possible.**

Manifests in one module should never reference files or templates stored in another module.

Be wary of having classes declare classes from other modules, as this makes modules harder to redistribute. When possible, it's best to isolate "super-classes" that declare many other classes in a local "site" module.

For more best practices, see the [Puppet Modules Style Guide](/guides/style_guide.html).
