This page lists changes to the `puppet-agent` package. For details about changes to components in a `puppet-agent` release, follow the links to those components in the package release's notes.

The `puppet-agent` package's version numbers use the format X.Y.Z, where:

* X must increase for major backwards-incompatible changes
* Y may increase for backwards-compatible new functionality
* Z may increase for bug fixes

## If you're upgrading from Puppet 3.x

The `puppet-agent` package installs the latest version of Puppet 4. Also read the [Puppet 4.0 release notes](/puppet/4.0/reference/release_notes.html), since they cover any breaking changes since Puppet 3.8.

Also of interest: [About Agent](./about_agent.html) and the [Puppet 4.6 release notes](./release_notes.html).
