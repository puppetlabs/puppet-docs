# Report Reference

Puppet clients can report back to the server after each transaction.  This
transaction report is sent as a YAML dump of the
`Puppet::Transaction::Report` class and includes every log message that was
generated during the transaction along with as many metrics as Puppet knows how
to collect.  See [Reports and Reporting](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Reports_And_Reporting) for more information on how to use reports.

Currently, clients default to not sending in reports; you can enable reporting
by setting the `report` parameter to true.

To use a report, set the `reports` parameter on the server; multiple
reports must be comma-separated.  You can also specify `none` to disable
reports entirely.

Puppet provides multiple report handlers that will process client reports:

http
----
Send reports via HTTP or HTTPS. This report processor submits reports as
POST requests to the address in the `reporturl` setting. The body of each POST
request is the YAML dump of a Puppet::Transaction::Report object, and the
Content-Type is set as `application/x-yaml`.

log
---
Send all received logs to the local log destinations.  Usually
the log destination is syslog.

rrdgraph
--------
Graph all available data about hosts using the RRD library.  You
must have the Ruby RRDtool library installed to use this report, which
you can get from
[the RubyRRDTool RubyForge page](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyrrdtool/).
This package may also be available as `librrd-ruby`, `ruby-rrd`, or `rrdtool-ruby` in your
distribution's package management system.  The library and/or package will both
require the binary `rrdtool` package from your distribution to be installed.

This report will create, manage, and graph RRD database files for each
of the metrics generated during transactions, and it will create a
few simple html files to display the reporting host's graphs.  At this
point, it will not create a common index file to display links to
all hosts.

All RRD files and graphs get created in the `rrddir` directory.  If
you want to serve these publicly, you should be able to just alias that
directory in a web server.

If you really know what you're doing, you can tune the `rrdinterval`,
which defaults to the `runinterval`.

store
-----
Store the yaml report on disk.  Each host sends its report as a YAML dump
and this just stores the file on disk, in the `reportdir` directory.

These files collect quickly -- one every half hour -- so it is a good idea
to perform some maintenance on them if you use this report (it's the only
default report).

tagmail
-------
This report sends specific log messages to specific email addresses
based on the tags in the log messages.

See the [documentation on tags](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Using_Tags) for more information.

To use this report, you must create a `tagmail.conf` file in the location
specified by the `tagmap` setting.  This is a simple file that maps tags to
email addresses:  Any log messages in the report that match the specified
tags will be sent to the specified email addresses.

Lines in the `tagmail.conf` file consist of a comma-separated list
of tags, a colon, and a comma-separated list of email addresses.
Tags can be !negated with a leading exclamation mark, which will
subtract any messages with that tag from the set of events handled
by that line.

Puppet's log levels (`debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warning`, `err`,
`alert`, `emerg`, `crit`, and `verbose`) can also be used as tags,
and there is an `all` tag that will always match all log messages.

An example `tagmail.conf`:

    all: me@domain.com
    webserver, !mailserver: httpadmins@domain.com

This will send all messages to `me@domain.com`, and all messages from
webservers that are not also from mailservers to `httpadmins@domain.com`.

If you are using anti-spam controls such as grey-listing on your mail
server, you should whitelist the sending email address (controlled by
`reportfrom` configuration option) to ensure your email is not discarded as spam.
