Puppet 3 introduces several new features and some backwards-incompatible changes. **Before upgrading from Puppet 2.x, you should read [Backwards-Incompatible Changes][backwards] below** --- you may need to make changes to your configuration and manifests. 

Flagship Features in Puppet 3.x
-----

### Improved Version Numbering

Puppet 3 marks the beginning of a new version scheme for Puppet releases. Beginning with 3.0.0, Puppet uses a strict three-field version number:

* The leftmost segment of the version number must increase for major backwards-incompatible changes.
* The middle segment may increase for backwards-compatible new functionality.
* The rightmost segment may increase for bug fixes.

### Major Speed Increase

Puppet 3 is faster than Puppet 2.6 and _significantly_ faster than Puppet 2.7. The exact change will depend on your site's configuration and Puppet code, but many 2.7 users have seen up to a 50% improvement. 

### Automatic Data Bindings for Class Parameters

When you declare or assign classes, Puppet now automatically looks up parameter values in Hiera. See [Classes][] for more details. 

### Solaris Improvements 

* Puppet now supports the ipkg format, and is able to "hold" packages (install without activating) on Solaris.
* Zones support is fixed. 
* Zpool support is significantly improved.



Backwards-Incompatible Changes in 3.0
-----

[backwards]: #backwards-incompatible-changes-in-30

### Dependencies and Supported Systems

* Puppet 3 adds support for Ruby 1.9.3, and drops support for Ruby 1.8.5. (Puppet Labs is publishing Ruby 1.8.7 packages in its repositories to help users who are still on RHEL and CentOS 5.)
    * Note that `puppet doc` is only supported on Ruby 1.8.7, due to 1.9's changes to the underlying RDoc library. See [ticket # 11786](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/11786) for more information.
* [Hiera][] is now a dependency of Puppet.
* Puppet now requires Facter 1.6.2 or later.
* Support for Mac OS X 10.4 has been dropped.

### Puppet Language Changes

#### Dynamic Scope for Variables is Removed

Dynamic scoping of variables, which was deprecated in Puppet 2.7, has been removed. See [Language: Scope][lang_scope] for more details. The most recent 2.7 release logs warnings about any variables in your code that are still being looked up dynamically. 

> **Upgrade note:** Before upgrading from Puppet 2.x, you should do the following: 
> 
> * Restart your puppet master --- this is necessary because deprecation warnings are only produced once per run, and warnings that were already logged may not appear again in your logs until a restart. 
> * Allow all of your nodes to check in and retrieve a catalog.
> * Examine your puppet master's logs for dynamic scope warnings.
> * Edit any manifests referenced in the warnings to remove the dynamic lookup behavior. Use [fully qualified variable names][qualified_vars] where necessary, and move makeshift data hierarchies out of your manifests and into [Hiera][].


#### Parameter lists in class and defined type **definitions** must include a dollar sign (`$`) prefix for each parameter. In other words, parameters must be styled like variables. Non-variable-like parameter lists have been deprecated since at least Puppet 0.23.0. 

  The syntax for class and defined resource **declarations** is unchanged.

  Right:
  
      define vhost ($port = 80, $vhostdir) { ... }
  
  Wrong:
  
      define vhost (port = 80, vhostdir) { ... }
  
  Unchanged:
  
      vhost {'web01.example.com':
        port     => 8080,
        vhostdir => '/etc/apache2/conf.d',
      }

### Deprecated Commands Are Removed

The legacy standalone executables, which were replaced by subcommands in Puppet 2.6, have been removed. Additionally, running `puppet` without a subcommand no longer defaults to `puppet apply`.


Pre-2.6       | Post-2.6
--------------|--------------
puppetmasterd | puppet master
puppetd       | puppet agent
puppet        | puppet apply
puppetca      | puppet cert
ralsh         | puppet resource
puppetrun     | puppet kick
puppetqd      | puppet queue
filebucket    | puppet filebucket
puppetdoc     | puppet doc
pi            | puppet describe

> **Upgrade note:** Examine your Puppet init scripts, the configuration of the puppet master's web server, and any wrapper scripts you may be using, and ensure that they are using the new subcommands instead of the legacy standalone commands. 

### Changed Application Behavior

#### Puppet Apply's `--apply` Option Is Removed

The `--apply` option has been removed. It was replaced by `--catalog`. 

#### Console Output Formatting Changes

The format of messages displayed to the console has changed slightly, potentially leading to scripts that watch these messages breaking. Additionally, we now use STDERR appropriately on \*nix platforms.

> **Upgrade Note:** If you scrape Puppet's console output, revise the relevant scripts.

This does not change the formatting of messages logged through other channels (eg: syslog, files), which remain as they were before. [See bug #13559 for details](https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/13559)


### Removed and Modified Settings

The following settings have been removed: 

* `factsync` (Deprecated since Puppet 0.25 and replaced with `pluginsync`; see [ticket #2277](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/2277))
* `ca_days` (Replaced with `ca_ttl`)
* `servertype` (No longer needed, due to [removal of built-in Mongrel support](#special-case-mongrel-support-is-removed))
* `downcasefact` (Long-since deprecated)
* `reportserver` (Long-since deprecated; replaced with `report_server`)


The following settings now behave differently:

* `pluginsync` is now enabled by default
* `cacrl` can no longer be set to `false`. Instead, Puppet will now ignore the CRL if the file in this setting is not present on disk.

### Puppet Master Web Server Changes

#### Rack Configuration Is Changed

Puppet master's `config.ru` file has changed format slightly. Previously the config.ru used `Puppet::Application` to start the puppet master:

    $0 = "master"
    
    ARGV << "--rack"
    ARGV << "--confdir" << "/etc/puppet"
    require 'puppet/application/master'
    run Puppet::Application[:master].run

This needs to be changed to `Puppet::Util::CommandLine`

    $0 = "master"
    
    ARGV << "--rack"
    ARGV << "--confdir" << "/etc/puppet"
    require 'puppet/util/command_line'
    run Puppet::Util::CommandLine.new.execute

> **Upgrade note:** If you run puppet master via a Rack server like Passenger, you **must** change the `config.ru` file as described above.

#### Special-Case Mongrel Support Is Removed

Previously, the puppet master had special-case support for running under Mongrel. Since Puppet's standard Rack support can also be used with Mongrel, this redundant code has been removed. 

> **Upgrade note:** If you are using Mongrel to run your puppet master, re-configure it to run Puppet as a standard Rack application.

### Changes to Core Resource Types

#### File

* The `recurse` parameter can no longer set recursion depth, and must be set to `true`, `false`, or `remote`. Use the `recurselimit` parameter to set recursion depth. (Setting depth with the `recurse` parameter has been deprecated since at least Puppet 2.6.8.)
  
#### Mount

* The `path` parameter has been removed. It was deprecated and replaced by `name` some time before Puppet 0.25.0.

#### Package

* The `type` parameter has been removed. It was deprecated and replaced by `provider` some time before Puppet 0.25.0.
* The `msi` provider has been deprecated in favor of the more versatile `windows` provider. 
* The `install_options` parameter for Windows packages now accepts an array of mixed strings and hashes; however, it remains backwards-compatible with the 2.7 single hash format.
* A new `uninstall_options` parameter was added for Windows packages. It uses the same semantics as `install_options`.

#### Exec

* The `logoutput` parameter now defaults to `on_failure`.
* Due to misleading values, the `HOME` and `USER` environment variables are now unset when running commands. 

#### Metaparameters

* The `check` metaparameter has been removed. It was deprecated and replaced by `audit` in Puppet 2.6.0.


### Changes to REST API

#### `auth no` in `auth.conf` Is Now the Same as `auth any'

Previously, `auth no` in [auth.conf][auth_conf] would reject connections with valid certificates. This was confusing, and the behavior has been removed; `auth no` now allows any kind of connection, same as `auth any`.

### New `allow_ip` Directive in `auth.conf`; IP Addresses Disallowed in `allow` Directive

To allow hosts based on IP address, use `allow_ip`. It functions exactly like `allow` in all respects except that it does not support backreferences. The `allow` directive now assumes that the string is not an IP address.

#### "Resource Type" API Has Changed

The API for querying resource types has changed to more closely match standard Puppet terminology.  This is most likely to be visible to any external tools that were using the REST API to query for information about resource types. 

* You can now add a `kind` option to your request, which will allow you to filter results by one of the following kinds of resource types: `class`, `node`, `defined_type`.
* The API would previously return a field called `type` for each result; this has been changed to `kind`.
* The API would previously return the value `hostclass` for the `type` field for classes; this has been changed to `class`.
* The API would previously return the value `definition` for the `type` field for classes; this has been changed to `defined_type`.
* The API would previously return a field called `arguments` for any result that contained a parameter list; this has been changed to `parameters`.

An example of the new output:

    [
      {
        "line": 1,
        "file": "/home/cprice/work/puppet/test/master/conf/modules/resource_type_foo/manifests/init.pp",
        "name": "resource_type_foo",
        "kind": "class"
      },
      {
        "line": 1,
        "file": "/home/cprice/work/puppet/test/master/conf/modules/resource_type_foo/manifests/my_parameterized_class.pp",
        "parameters": {
          "param1": null,
          "param2": "\"default2\""
        },
        "name": "resource_type_foo::my_parameterized_class",
        "kind": "class"
      },
      {
        "line": 1,
        "file": "/home/cprice/work/puppet/test/master/conf/modules/resource_type_foo/manifests/my_defined_type.pp",
        "parameters": {
          "param1": null,
          "param2": "\"default2\""
        },
        "name": "resource_type_foo::my_defined_type",
        "kind": "defined_type"
      },
      {
        "line": 1,
        "file": "/home/cprice/work/puppet/test/master/conf/modules/resource_type_foo/manifests/my_node.pp",
        "name": "my_node",
        "kind": "node"
      }
    ]

#### XML-RPC support is entirely removed

XML-RPC support has been removed entirely, in favor of the REST API introduced in 2.6. XML-RPC support has been deprecated since 2.6.0.



### Changes to Ruby API, Including Type and Provider Interface

The following hard changes have been made to Puppet's internal Ruby API:

* **Helper code:** `String#lines` and `IO#lines` revert to standard Ruby semantics. Puppet used to emulate these methods to accomodate ancient Ruby versions, and its emulation was slightly inaccurate. We've stopped emulating them, so they now include the separator character (`$/`, default value `\n`) in the output and include content where they previously wouldn't.
* **Functions:** Puppet functions called from Ruby code (templates, other functions, etc.) must be called with an **array of arguments.** Puppet has always expected this, but was not enforcing it. See [ticket #15756](https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/15756) for more information.
* **Faces:** The `set_default_format` method has been removed. It had been deprecated and replaced by `render_as`.
* **Resource types:** The following methods for type objects have been removed: `states`, `newstate`, `[ ]`, `[ ]=`, `alias`, `clear`, `create`, `delete`, `each`, and `has_key?`.
* **Providers:** The `mkmodelmethods` method for provider objects has been removed. It was replaced with `mk_resource_methods`.
* **Providers:** The `LANG`, `LC_*`, and `HOME` environment variables are now unset when providers and other code execute external commands.

The following Ruby methods are now deprecated:

* **Applications:** The `Puppet::Application` class's `#should_parse_config`, `#should_not_parse_config`, and `#should_parse_config?` methods are now deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. They are no longer necessary for individual applications and faces, since Puppet now automatically determines when the config file should be re-parsed.


### Changes to Agent Lockfile Behavior

Puppet agent now uses two lockfiles instead of one:

* The run-in-progress lockfile (configured with the `agent_catalog_run_lockfile` setting) is present if an agent catalog run is in progress. It contains the PID of the currently running process. 
* The disabled lockfile (configured with the `agent_disabled_lockfile` setting) is present if the agent was disabled by an administrator. The file is a JSON hash which **may** contain a `disabled_message` key, whose value should be a string with an explanatory message from the administrator. 

### Non-Administrator Windows Data Directory Is Changed

When running as a non-privileged user (i.e. not an Administrator), the location of Puppet's data directory has changed. Previously, it was in `~/.puppet`, but it is now located in the Local Application Data directory following Microsoft best-practices for per-user, non-roaming data. The location of the directory is contained in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` environment variable, which on Windows 2003 and earlier is: `%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data` On Windows Vista and later: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local`


New Backwards-Compatible Features in 3.0
-----

### Automatic Data Bindings for Class Parameters

When you declare or assign classes, Puppet now automatically looks up parameter values in Hiera. See [Classes][] for more details. 

### Solaris Improvements 

* Puppet now supports the ipkg format, and is able to "hold" packages (install without activating) on Solaris.
* Zones support is fixed. 
* Zpool support is significantly improved.


### Rubygem Extension Support

Puppet can now load extensions (including subcommands) and plugins (custom types/providers/functions) from gems. See [ticket #7788](https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/7788) for more information.

### Puppet Agent Is More Efficient in Daemon Mode

Puppet agent now forks a child process to run each catalog. This allows it to return memory to system more efficiently when running in daemon mode, and should reduce resource consumption for users who don't run puppet agent from cron.

### `puppet parser validate` Will Read From STDIN

Piped content to `puppet parser validate` will now be read and validated, rather than ignoring it and requiring a file on disk.

### The HTTP Report Processor Now Supports HTTPS

Use an `https://` URL in the `report_server` setting to submit reports to an HTTPS server.

### The `include` Function Now Accepts Arrays
