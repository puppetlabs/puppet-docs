> To install Puppet, first [view pre-install tasks](/pre_install.html).

Hardware
-----

The Puppet agent service has no particular hardware requirements and can run on nearly anything.

However, the Puppet master service is fairly resource intensive, and should be installed on a robust dedicated server.

* At minimum, your Puppet master server should have two processor cores and at least 1 GB RAM.
* To comfortably serve at least 1000 nodes, it should have 2-4 processor cores and at least 4 GB RAM.

The demands on the Puppet master will vary widely between different deployments. The total needs are affected by the number of agents being served, how frequently those agents check in, how many resources are being managed on each agent, and the complexity of the manifests and modules in use.

- OpenBSD 4.1 and later
- HP-UX

Basic Requirements
-----

If you're installing Puppet via the official packages, you won't need to worry about these prerequisites; your system's package manager will handle all of them. These are only listed for those running Puppet from source or on unsupported systems.

Puppet 4.2 has the following prerequisites:

### Ruby

Use one of the following versions of MRI (standard) Ruby:

* 2.1.x
* 2.0.x
* 1.9.3

**Note:** We currently only test and package with 2.1.x versions of Ruby, therefore we recommend you only use this version. Other interpreters and versions of Ruby are not covered by our tests, and may or may not work.

### Mandatory Libraries

- [Facter](http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/related-projects/facter/) 2.4.3 or later
- [Hiera](/hiera/latest/) 2.0.0 or later
- The `json` gem (any modern version).
- The [`rgen` gem](http://ruby-gen.org/downloads) version 0.6.6 or later is now required because Puppet [ `parser = future` is enabled by default](./experiments_future.html).

### Optional Libraries

- The `msgpack` gem is required if you are using [msgpack serialization](./experiments_msgpack.html).
