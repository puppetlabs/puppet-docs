This page lists the changes in Puppet 4.3 and its patch releases.

Puppet's version numbers use the format X.Y.Z, where:

* X must increase for major backwards-incompatible changes
* Y may increase for backwards-compatible new functionality
* Z may increase for bug fixes

## If You're Upgrading from Puppet 3.x

Make sure you also read the [Puppet 4.0 release notes](/puppet/4.0/reference/release_notes.html), since they cover any breaking changes since Puppet 3.8.

Also of interest: the [Puppet 4.2 release notes](/puppet/4.2/reference/release_notes.html) and [Puppet 4.1 release notes](/puppet/4.1/reference/release_notes.html).
