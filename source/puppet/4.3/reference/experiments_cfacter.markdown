Native Facter ("cfacter") is no longer an experimental feature --- Puppet 4.2 ships with Facter 3 as its default (and only) Facter implementation. The `cfacter` setting is now unnecessary, and raises an error if you set it to `true`.

For more info, see the [Facter 3.0 release notes.](/facter/3.0/release_notes.html)
