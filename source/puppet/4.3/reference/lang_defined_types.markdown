**Defined resource types** (also called **defined types** or **defines**) are blocks of Puppet code that can be evaluated multiple times with different parameters. Once defined, they act like a new resource type: you can cause the block to be evaluated by [declaring a resource][resource] of that new resource type.

Defines can be used as simple macros or as a lightweight way to develop fairly sophisticated resource types.

Syntax
-----

### Defining a Type

You can use a `define` statement to create a new defined resource type.

~~~ ruby
# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/apache/manifests/vhost.pp
define apache::vhost (Integer $port, String[1] $docroot, String[1] $servername = $title, String $vhost_name = '*') {
  include apache # contains Package['httpd'] and Service['httpd']
  include apache::params # contains common config settings
  $vhost_dir = $apache::params::vhost_dir
  file { "${vhost_dir}/${servername}.conf":
    content => template('apache/vhost-default.conf.erb'),
      # This template can access all of the parameters and variables from above.
    owner   => 'www',
    group   => 'www',
    mode    => '644',
    require => Package['httpd'],
    notify  => Service['httpd'],
  }
}
~~~

This creates a new resource type called `apache::vhost`.

The general form of a define statement is:

* The `define` keyword
* The [name][naming] of the defined type
* An optional **parameter list,** which consists of:
    * An opening parenthesis
    * A comma-separated list of **parameters** (e.g. `String $myparam = "default value"`). Each parameter consists of:
        * An optional [data type][literal_types], which will restrict the allowed values for the parameter (defaults to `Any`)
        * A [variable][] name to represent the parameter, including the `$` prefix
        * An optional equals (`=`) sign and **default value** (which must match the data type, if one was specified)
    * An optional trailing comma after the last parameter
    * A closing parenthesis
* An opening curly brace
* A block of arbitrary Puppet code, which generally contains at least one [resource declaration][resource]
* A closing curly brace

The definition does not cause the code in the block to be added to the [catalog][]; it only makes it available. To execute the code, you must declare one or more resources of the defined type.

### Declaring an Instance

Instances of a defined type (often just called "resources") can be declared the same way a [normal resource][resource] is declared. (That is, with a resource type, title, and set of attribute/value pairs.)

The **parameters** used when defining the type become the **attributes** (without the `$` prefix) used when declaring resources of that type. Parameters which have a **default value** are optional; if they are left out of the declaration, the default will be used. Parameters without defaults **must** be specified.

To declare a resource of the `apache::vhost` defined type from the example above:

~~~ ruby
apache::vhost {'homepages':
  port    => 8081,
  docroot => '/var/www-testhost',
}
~~~

Behavior
-----

If a defined type is present and loadable (see ["Location"](#location) below), you can declare resources of that defined type anywhere in your manifests.

Declaring a new resource of the defined type will make Puppet re-evaluate the block of code in the definition, using different values for the parameters.

### Parameters and Attributes

Every parameter of a defined type can be used as a local variable inside the definition. These variables are not set with [normal assignment statements][variable_assignment]; instead, each instance of the defined type uses its attributes to set them:

~~~ ruby
apache::vhost {'homepages':
  port    => 8081, # Becomes the value of $port
  docroot => '/var/www-testhost', # Becomes the value of $docroot
}
~~~

In the `define` statement that creates the defined type, each parameter can be preceeded by an optional [**data type**][literal_types]. If you include one, Puppet will check the parameter's value at runtime to make sure that it has the right data type, and raise an error if the value is illegal. If no data type is provided, the parameter will accept values of any data type.

Note that the special variables `$title` and `$name` are both set to the defined type's name automatically, so they can't be used as parameters.

### `$title` and `$name`

Every defined type gets two "free" parameters, which are always available and do not have to be explicitly added to the definition:

* `$title` is always set to the [title][] of the instance. Since it is guaranteed to be unique for each instance, it is useful when making sure that contained resources are unique. (See "[Resource Uniqueness](#resource-uniqueness)" below.)
* `$name` defaults to the value of `$title`, but users can optionally specify a different value when they declare an instance. This is only useful for mimicking the behavior of a resource with a namevar, which is usually unnecessary. If you are wondering whether to use `$name` or `$title`, use `$title`.

Unlike the other parameters, the values of `$title` and `$name` are already available **inside the parameter list.** This means you can use `$title` as the default value (or part of the default value) for another attribute:

~~~ ruby
define apache::vhost (Integer $port, String[1] $docroot, String $servername = $title, String[1] $vhost_name = '*') { ...
~~~

### Resource Uniqueness

Since multiple instances of a defined type might be declared in your manifests, you must make sure that every resource in the definition will be **different in every instance.** Failing to do this will result in compilation failures with a "duplicate resource declaration" error.

You can make resources different across instances by making their **titles** and **names/namevars** include the value of `$title` or another parameter.

~~~ ruby
file { "${vhost_dir}/${servername}.conf":
~~~

Since `$title` (and possibly other parameters) will be unique per instance, this ensures the resources will be unique as well.

### Containment

Every instance of a defined type [contains][] all of its unique resources. This means any [relationships][] formed between the instance and another resource will be extended to every resource that makes up the instance.

### Metaparameters

The declaration of a defined type instance can include any [metaparameter][metaparameters]. If it does:

* Every resource contained in the instance will also have that metaparameter. So if you declare a defined resource with `noop => true`, every resource contained in it will also have `noop => true`, unless they specifically override it. Metaparameters which can take more than one value (like the [relationship][relationships] metaparameters) will merge the values from the container and any specific values from the individual resource.
* The value of the metaparameter can be used as a variable in the definition, as though it were a normal parameter. (For example, in an instance declared with `require => Class['ntp']`, the local value of `$require` would be `Class['ntp']`.)

### Resource Defaults

Just like with a normal resource type, you can declare [resource defaults][resource_defaults] for a defined type:

~~~ ruby
# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp
Apache::Vhost {
  port => 80,
}
~~~

In this example, every `apache::vhost` resource would default to port 80 unless specifically overridden.

Location
-----

Defined types can (and should) be stored in [modules][]. Puppet is automatically aware of any defined types in a valid module and can autoload them by name.

Definitions should be stored in the `manifests/` directory of a module with one definition per file, and each filename should reflect the name of its defined type. See [Module Fundamentals][modules] for more details.

A define statement isn't an expression, and can't be used where a value is expected.

> #### Aside: Best Practices
>
> You should usually only load defined types from modules. Although the additional options below this aside will work, they are not recommended.

You can also put define statements in [the site manifest][sitedotpp]. If you do so, they may be placed anywhere in the file and are not evaluation-order dependent.

Define statements may also be placed inside class definitions; however, this limits their availability to that class and is not recommended for any purpose. This is not formally deprecated in this version of Puppet, but may become so in a future release.


Naming
-----

[The characters allowed in a defined type's name are listed here][naming].

If the definition is stored in a module, its name must reflect its place in the module with its [namespace][namespaces]. See [Module Fundamentals][modules] for details.

Note that if a type's name has one or more [namespaces][] in it, each name segment must be capitalized when writing a [resource reference][references_namespaced], [collector][], or [resource default][resource_defaults]. (For example, a reference to the vhost resource declared above would be `Apache::Vhost['homepages']`.)
