Puppet supports two kinds of comments:

Shell-Style Comments
-----

Shell-style comments (also known as Ruby-style comments) begin with a hash symbol (`#`) and continue to the end of a line. They can start at the beginning of a line or partway through a line that began with code.

~~~ ruby
# This is a comment
file {'/etc/ntp.conf': # This is another comment
  ensure => file,
  owner  => root,
}
~~~


C-Style Comments
-----

C-style comments are delimited by slashes with inner asterisks. They can span multiple lines. This comment style is less frequently used than shell-style.

~~~ ruby
/*
  this is a comment
*/
~~~
