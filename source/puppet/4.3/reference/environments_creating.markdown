Structure of an Environment
-----

An environment is just a directory that follows a few conventions:

* The directory name is the environment name.
* It must be located on the Puppet master server(s) in one of the `environmentpath` directories, usually `$codedir/environments`. (See [the `environmentpath` section of the configuring environments page.][env_conf_path])
* It should contain a `modules` directory. If present, it will become part of the environment's default `modulepath`.
* It should contain a `manifests` directory, which will be the environment's default [main manifest.][manifest_dir]
* It may contain [an `environment.conf` file][environment.conf], which can locally override several settings, including `modulepath` and `manifest`.

Puppet Enterprise Requirements
-----

[inpage_pe]: #puppet-enterprise-requirements

With Puppet Enterprise (PE), **every** environment must meet two extra requirements.

### Filebucket Resource in Main Manifest

The [main manifest][manifest_dir] **must** contain the following snippet of Puppet code, which PE uses to back up file contents:

~~~ ruby
    # Define filebucket 'main':
    filebucket { 'main':
      server => '<YOUR SERVER HERE>',
      path   => false,
    }

    # Make filebucket 'main' the default backup location for all File resources:
    File { backup => 'main' }
~~~

You should do the following to ensure this is present:

* Make sure you set `default_manifest = $codedir/manifests` in [puppet.conf][]. This will provide the necessary code to any environments that don't override their main manifest in [environment.conf][].
* If any environments **do** provide their own main manifests, make sure you copy this code from the `/etc/puppetlabs/code/manifests/site.pp` file into some file in their manifests directory.

### Modulepath Includes `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules`

The [modulepath][] **must** include the `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules` directory, since PE uses modules in that directory to configure orchestration and other features.

* If you **upgraded** from a previous version of PE instead of doing a fresh install, make sure to set `basemodulepath = $codedir/modules:/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules` in [puppet.conf][]. This will include the system modules in the **default** modulepath for every environment. If you installed PE 3.8 or higher from scratch, this path is already set by default.
* If you use [environment.conf][] to override the modulepath (see below), make sure it includes either `$basemodulepath` or `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules`.


Allowed Environment Names
-----

Environment names can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. That is, they must match the following regular expression:

`\A[a-z0-9_]+\Z`


What Environments Provide
-----

An environment can define three resources the Puppet master will use when compiling catalogs for agent nodes:

* The modulepath
* The main manifest
* The config version script


### The Modulepath

The **modulepath** is the list of directories Puppet will load modules from. See [the reference page on the modulepath][modulepath] for more details about how Puppet uses it.

#### The Default Modulepath

**By default,** the effective modulepath for a given environment will be:

    <MODULES DIRECTORY FROM ENVIRONMENT>:$basemodulepath

That is, Puppet will add the environment's `modules` directory to the value of the [`basemodulepath` setting][basemodulepath] from [puppet.conf][], with the environment's modules getting priority. If the `modules` directory is empty or absent, Puppet will only use modules from directories in the `basemodulepath`.

#### Configuring the Modulepath

You can configure a different modulepath for an environment by setting `modulepath` in its [environment.conf][] file. Note that the global `modulepath` setting from [puppet.conf][] will never be used by an environment.

**Note:** The `modulepath` should almost always include `$basemodulepath`, and if you're using PE, it **must** include `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules`. ([See above.][inpage_pe]) This path is included in the `basemodulepath` by default in PE 3.8.

#### Checking the Modulepath

You can view an environment's effective modulepath by specifying the environment when [requesting the setting value][config_print]:

    $ sudo puppet config print modulepath --section master --environment test
    /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/test/modules:/etc/puppetlabs/code/modules:/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules


### The Main Manifest

The **main manifest** is Puppet's starting point for compiling a catalog. See [the reference page on the main manifest][manifest_dir] for more details.

#### The Default Main Manifest

Unless you say otherwise in [environment.conf][], an environment will use Puppet's global [`default_manifest` setting][default_manifest] to determine its main manifest.

The value of this setting can be an **absolute path** to a manifest that all environments will share, or a **relative path** to a file or directory inside each environment.

The default value of `default_manifest` is `./manifests` --- that is, the environment's own `manifests` directory.

If the file or directory specified by `default_manifest` is empty or absent, Puppet will **not** fall back to any other manifest; instead, it will behave as though you used a totally blank main manifest. Note that the global `manifest` setting from [puppet.conf][] will never be used by an environment.


#### Configuring the Main Manifest

You can configure a different main manifest for an environment by setting `manifest` in its [environment.conf][] file.

As with the global `default_manifest` setting, you can specify a relative path (to be resolved within the environment's directory) or an absolute path.

**Note:** If you are using Puppet Enterprise, you **must** ensure that the default filebucket resource is included in the main manifest. ([See above.][inpage_pe])

#### Locking the Main Manifest

If you want to prevent any environment from setting its own main manifest, you can lock all environments to a single global manifest with [the `disable_per_environment_manifest` setting.][disable_per_environment_manifest] For details, see [the docs for this setting.][disable_per_environment_manifest]

### The Config Version Script

Puppet automatically adds a **config version** to every catalog it compiles, as well as to messages in reports. The version is an arbitrary piece of data that can be used to identify catalogs and events.

#### The Default Config Version

By default, the config version will be the **time** at which the catalog was compiled (as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970).

#### Configuring the Config Version

You can specify an executable script that will determine an environment's config version by setting `config_version` in its [environment.conf][] file. Puppet will run this script when compiling a catalog for a node in the environment, and use its output as the config version. Note that the global `config_version` setting from [puppet.conf][] will never be used by an environment.

**Note:** If you're using a system binary like `git rev-parse`, make sure to specify the absolute path to it! If `config_version` is set to a relative path, Puppet will look for the binary _in the environment,_ not in the system's `PATH`.

The `environment.conf` File
-----

An environment can contain an `environment.conf` file, which can override values for certain settings.

{% partial ./_environment_conf_settings.md %}

See [the page on `environment.conf` for more details.][environment.conf]
