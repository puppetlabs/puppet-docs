The following are common configuration tasks that you can manage with Open Source Puppet. These steps provide an excellent introduction to the capabilities of Puppet.

## NTP Quick Start Guide
NTP is one of the most crucial, yet easiest, services to configure and manage with Puppet. Follow [this guide](./quick_start_ntp.html) to properly get time synced across all your Puppet-managed nodes.

## DNS Quick Start Guide
[This guide](./quick_start_dns.html) provides instructions for getting started managing a simple DNS nameserver file with Puppet. A nameserver ensures that the “human-readable” names you type in your browser (for example, `example.com`) resolve to IP addresses that computers can read.

## Sudo Users Quick Start Guide
Managing sudo on your agents allows you to control which system users have access to elevated privileges. [This guide](./quick_start_sudo.html) provides instructions for getting started managing sudo privileges across your nodes, using a module from the Puppet Forge in conjunction with a simple module you will write.

## Firewall Quick Start Guide
Follow the steps in [this guide](./quick_start_firewall.html) to get started managing firewall rules with a simple module you’ll write that defines those rules.
