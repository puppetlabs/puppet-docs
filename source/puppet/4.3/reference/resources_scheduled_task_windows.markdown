Puppet can create, edit, and delete scheduled tasks, which are a Windows-only resource type.

Puppet can manage the task name, the enabled/disabled status, the command, any arguments, the working directory, the user and password, and triggers. A complete scheduled task resource looks something like this:

~~~ ruby
    scheduled_task { 'An every-other-day task':
      ensure    => present,
      enabled   => true,
      command   => 'C:\path\to\command.exe',
      arguments => '/flags /to /pass',
      trigger   => {
        schedule   => daily,
        every      => 2,            # Specifies every other day. Defaults to 1 (every day).
        start_date => '2011-08-31', # Defaults to 'today'
        start_time => '08:00',      # Must be specified
        minutes_interval => '60',   # Repeat this task every 60 minutes
        minutes_duration => '300',  # The task will run for a total of five hours
      }
    }
~~~
