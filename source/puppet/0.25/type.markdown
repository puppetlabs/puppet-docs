Type Reference

<p><strong>This page is autogenerated; any changes will get overwritten</strong> <em>(last generated on Thu Feb 24 17:21:45 -0800 2011)</em></p>


Resource Types
=====

<ul>
<li><p>The <em>namevar</em> is the parameter used to uniquely identify a type instance.
This is the parameter that gets assigned when a string is provided before
the colon in a type declaration.  In general, only developers will need to
worry about which parameter is the <code>namevar</code>.</p>
<p>In the following code:</p>
<pre><code>
file { &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;:
    owner =&gt; root,
    group =&gt; root,
    mode =&gt; 644
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>/etc/passwd</code> is considered the title of the file object (used for things like
dependency handling), and because <code>path</code> is the namevar for <code>file</code>, that
string is assigned to the <code>path</code> parameter.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Parameters</em> determine the specific configuration of the instance.  They either
directly modify the system (internally, these are called properties) or they affect
how the instance behaves (e.g., adding a search path for <code>exec</code> instances
or determining recursion on <code>file</code> instances).</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Providers</em> provide low-level functionality for a given resource type.  This is
usually in the form of calling out to external commands.</p>
<p>When required binaries are specified for providers, fully qualifed paths
indicate that the binary must exist at that specific path and unqualified
binaries indicate that Puppet will search for the binary using the shell
path.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Features</em> are abilities that some providers might not support.  You can use the list
of supported features to determine how a given provider can be used.</p>
<p>Resource types define features they can use, and providers can be tested to see
which features they provide.</p>
</li>
</ul>

#### Parameters


##### changes

<p>The changes which should be applied to the filesystem. This
can be either a string which contains a command or an array of commands.
Commands supported are:</p>
<pre><code>
set [PATH] [VALUE]     Sets the value VALUE at loction PATH
rm [PATH]              Removes the node at location PATH
remove [PATH]          Synonym for rm
clear [PATH]           Keeps the node at PATH, but removes the value.
ins [LABEL] [WHERE] [PATH]
                       Inserts an empty node LABEL either [WHERE={before|after}] PATH.
insert [LABEL] [WHERE] [PATH]
                       Synonym for ins
</code></pre>
<p>If the parameter 'context' is set that value is prepended to PATH</p>


##### context

<p>Optional context path. This value is pre-pended to the paths of all changes if the
path is relative. So a path specified as /files/foo will not be prepended with the
context whild files/foo will be prepended</p>


##### force

<p>Optional command to force the augeas type to execute even if it thinks changes
will not be made. This does not overide the only setting. If onlyif is set, then the
foce setting will not override that result</p>


##### load_path

<p>Optional colon separated list of directories; these directories are searched for schema definitions</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of this task. Used for uniqueness</p>


##### onlyif

<p>Optional augeas command and comparisons to control the execution of this type.
Supported onlyif syntax:</p>
<pre><code>
get [AUGEAS_PATH] [COMPARATOR] [STRING]
match [MATCH_PATH] size [COMPARATOR] [INT]
match [MATCH_PATH] include [STRING]
match [MATCH_PATH] not_include [STRING]
match [MATCH_PATH] == [AN_ARRAY]
match [MATCH_PATH] != [AN_ARRAY]
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<pre><code>
AUGEAS_PATH is a valid path scoped by the context
MATCH_PATH is a valid match synatx scoped by the context
COMPARATOR is in the set [&gt; &gt;= != == &lt;= &lt;]
STRING is a string
INT is a number
AN_ARRAY is in the form ['a string', 'another']
</code></pre>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>augeas</strong>:       Supported features: <code>execute_changes</code>, <code>need_to_run?</code>, <code>parse_commands</code>.</li>
</ul>


##### returns

<p>The expected return code from the augeas command. Should not be set</p>


##### root

<p>A file system path; all files loaded by Augeas are loaded underneath ROOT</p>


##### type_check

<p>Set to true if augeas should perform typechecking. Optional, defaults to false  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>



<hr />

### computer

<p>Computer object management using DirectoryService
on OS X.</p>
<p>Note that these are distinctly different kinds of objects to 'hosts',
as they require a MAC address and can have all sorts of policy attached to
them.</p>
<p>This provider only manages Computer objects in the local directory service
domain, not in remote directories.</p>
<p>If you wish to manage /etc/hosts on Mac OS X, then simply use the host
type as per other platforms.</p>
<p>This type primarily exists to create localhost Computer objects that MCX
policy can then be attached to.</p>

#### Parameters


##### en_address

<p>The MAC address of the primary network interface. Must match en0.</p>


##### ensure

<p>Control the existences of this computer record. Set this attribute to
<code>present</code> to ensure the computer record exists.  Set it to <code>absent</code>
to delete any computer records with this name  Valid values are <code>present</code>, <code>absent</code>.</p>


##### ip_address

<p>The IP Address of the Computer object.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The authoritative 'short' name of the computer record.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>directoryservice</strong>: Computer object management using DirectoryService on OS X.</dt>
<dd><p>Note that these are distinctly different kinds of objects to 'hosts',
as they require a MAC address and can have all sorts of policy attached to
them.</p>
<p>This provider only manages Computer objects in the local directory service
domain, not in remote directories.</p>
<p>If you wish to manage /etc/hosts on Mac OS X, then simply use the host
type as per other platforms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>darwin</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>


##### realname

<p>The 'long' name of the computer record.</p>



<hr />

### cron

<p>Installs and manages cron jobs.  All fields except the command
and the user are optional, although specifying no periodic
fields would result in the command being executed every
minute.  While the name of the cron job is not part of the actual
job, it is used by Puppet to store and retrieve it.</p>
<p>If you specify a cron job that matches an existing job in every way
except name, then the jobs will be considered equivalent and the
new name will be permanently associated with that job.  Once this
association is made and synced to disk, you can then manage the job
normally (e.g., change the schedule of the job).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
cron { logrotate:
    command =&gt; &quot;/usr/sbin/logrotate&quot;,
    user =&gt; root,
    hour =&gt; 2,
    minute =&gt; 0
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that all cron values can be specified as an array of values:</p>
<pre><code>
cron { logrotate:
    command =&gt; &quot;/usr/sbin/logrotate&quot;,
    user =&gt; root,
    hour =&gt; [2, 4]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or using ranges, or the step syntax <code>*/2</code> (although there's no guarantee that
your <code>cron</code> daemon supports it):</p>
<pre><code>
cron { logrotate:
    command =&gt; &quot;/usr/sbin/logrotate&quot;,
    user =&gt; root,
    hour =&gt; ['2-4'],
    minute =&gt; '*/10'
}
</code></pre>

#### Parameters


##### command

<p>The command to execute in the cron job.  The environment
provided to the command varies by local system rules, and it is
best to always provide a fully qualified command.  The user's
profile is not sourced when the command is run, so if the
user's environment is desired it should be sourced manually.</p>
<p>All cron parameters support <code>absent</code> as a value; this will
remove any existing values for that field.</p>


##### ensure

<p>The basic property that the resource should be in.  Valid values are <code>present</code>, <code>absent</code>.</p>


##### environment

<p>Any environment settings associated with this cron job.  They
will be stored between the header and the job in the crontab.  There
can be no guarantees that other, earlier settings will not also
affect a given cron job.</p>
<p>Also, Puppet cannot automatically determine whether an existing,
unmanaged environment setting is associated with a given cron
job.  If you already have cron jobs with environment settings,
then Puppet will keep those settings in the same place in the file,
but will not associate them with a specific job.</p>
<p>Settings should be specified exactly as they should appear in
the crontab, e.g., <code>PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin</code>.</p>


##### hour

<p>The hour at which to run the cron job. Optional;
if specified, must be between 0 and 23, inclusive.</p>


##### minute

<p>The minute at which to run the cron job.
Optional; if specified, must be between 0 and 59, inclusive.</p>


##### month

<p>The month of the year.  Optional; if specified
must be between 1 and 12 or the month name (e.g., December).</p>


##### monthday

<p>The day of the month on which to run the
command.  Optional; if specified, must be between 1 and 31.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The symbolic name of the cron job.  This name
is used for human reference only and is generated automatically
for cron jobs found on the system.  This generally won't
matter, as Puppet will do its best to match existing cron jobs
against specified jobs (and Puppet adds a comment to cron jobs it
adds), but it is at least possible that converting from
unmanaged jobs to managed jobs might require manual
intervention.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>crontab</strong>:   Required binaries: <code>crontab</code>.</li>
</ul>


##### special

<p>Special schedules only supported on FreeBSD.</p>


##### target

<p>Where the cron job should be stored.  For crontab-style
entries this is the same as the user and defaults that way.
Other providers default accordingly.</p>


##### user

<p>The user to run the command as.  This user must
be allowed to run cron jobs, which is not currently checked by
Puppet.</p>
<p>The user defaults to whomever Puppet is running as.</p>


##### weekday

<p>The weekday on which to run the command.
Optional; if specified, must be between 0 and 7, inclusive, with
0 (or 7) being Sunday, or must be the name of the day (e.g., Tuesday).</p>



<hr />

### exec

<p>Executes external commands.  It is critical that all commands
executed using this mechanism can be run multiple times without
harm, i.e., they are <em>idempotent</em>.  One useful way to create idempotent
commands is to use the checks like <code>creates</code> to avoid running the
command unless some condition is met.</p>
<p>Note also that you can restrict an <code>exec</code> to only run when it receives
events by using the <code>refreshonly</code> parameter; this is a useful way to
have your configuration respond to events with arbitrary commands.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that <code>exec</code> is special, in that it is not
currently considered an error to have multiple <code>exec</code> instances
with the same name.  This was done purely because it had to be this
way in order to get certain functionality, but it complicates things.
In particular, you will not be able to use <code>exec</code> instances that
share their commands with other instances as a dependency, since
Puppet has no way of knowing which instance you mean.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
# defined in the production class
exec { &quot;make&quot;:
    cwd =&gt; &quot;/prod/build/dir&quot;,
    path =&gt; &quot;/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin&quot;
}

. etc. .

# defined in the test class
exec { &quot;make&quot;:
    cwd =&gt; &quot;/test/build/dir&quot;,
    path =&gt; &quot;/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Any other type would throw an error, complaining that you had
the same instance being managed in multiple places, but these are
obviously different images, so <code>exec</code> had to be treated specially.</p>
<p>It is recommended to avoid duplicate names whenever possible.</p>
<p>Note that if an <code>exec</code> receives an event from another resource,
it will get executed again (or execute the command specified in
<code>refresh</code>, if there is one).</p>
<p>There is a strong tendency to use <code>exec</code> to do whatever work Puppet
can't already do; while this is obviously acceptable (and unavoidable)
in the short term, it is highly recommended to migrate work from <code>exec</code>
to native Puppet types as quickly as possible.  If you find that
you are doing a lot of work with <code>exec</code>, please at least notify
us at Puppet Labs what you are doing, and hopefully we can work with
you to get a native resource type for the work you are doing.</p>

#### Parameters


##### command

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The actual command to execute.  Must either be fully qualified
or a search path for the command must be provided.  If the command
succeeds, any output produced will be logged at the instance's
normal log level (usually <code>notice</code>), but if the command fails
(meaning its return code does not match the specified code) then
any output is logged at the <code>err</code> log level.</p>


##### creates

<p>A file that this command creates.  If this
parameter is provided, then the command will only be run
if the specified file does not exist:</p>
<pre><code>
exec { &quot;tar xf /my/tar/file.tar&quot;:
    cwd =&gt; &quot;/var/tmp&quot;,
    creates =&gt; &quot;/var/tmp/myfile&quot;,
    path =&gt; [&quot;/usr/bin&quot;, &quot;/usr/sbin&quot;]
}
</code></pre>


##### cwd

<p>The directory from which to run the command.  If
this directory does not exist, the command will fail.</p>


##### env

<p>This parameter is deprecated. Use 'environment' instead.</p>


##### environment

<p>Any additional environment variables you want to set for a
command.  Note that if you use this to set PATH, it will override
the <code>path</code> attribute.  Multiple environment variables should be
specified as an array.</p>


##### group

<p>The group to run the command as.  This seems to work quite
haphazardly on different platforms -- it is a platform issue
not a Ruby or Puppet one, since the same variety exists when
running commands as different users in the shell.</p>


##### logoutput

<p>Whether to log output.  Defaults to logging output at the
loglevel for the <code>exec</code> resource. Use <em>on_failure</em> to only
log the output when the command reports an error.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>on_failure</code>.</p>


##### onlyif

<p>If this parameter is set, then this <code>exec</code> will only run if
the command returns 0.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>
exec { &quot;logrotate&quot;:
    path =&gt; &quot;/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin&quot;,
    onlyif =&gt; &quot;test `du /var/log/messages | cut -f1` -gt 100000&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This would run <code>logrotate</code> only if that test returned true.</p>
<p>Note that this command follows the same rules as the main command,
which is to say that it must be fully qualified if the path is not set.</p>
<p>Also note that onlyif can take an array as its value, eg:</p>
<pre><code>
onlyif =&gt; [&quot;test -f /tmp/file1&quot;, &quot;test -f /tmp/file2&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>This will only run the exec if /all/ conditions in the array return true.</p>


##### path

<p>The search path used for command execution.
Commands must be fully qualified if no path is specified.  Paths
can be specified as an array or as a colon-separated list.</p>


##### refresh

<p>How to refresh this command.  By default, the exec is just
called again when it receives an event from another resource,
but this parameter allows you to define a different command
for refreshing.</p>


##### refreshonly

<p>The command should only be run as a
refresh mechanism for when a dependent object is changed.  It only
makes sense to use this option when this command depends on some
other object; it is useful for triggering an action:</p>
<pre><code>
# Pull down the main aliases file
file { &quot;/etc/aliases&quot;:
    source =&gt; &quot;puppet://server/module/aliases&quot;
}

# Rebuild the database, but only when the file changes
exec { newaliases:
    path =&gt; [&quot;/usr/bin&quot;, &quot;/usr/sbin&quot;],
    subscribe =&gt; File[&quot;/etc/aliases&quot;],
    refreshonly =&gt; true
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that only <code>subscribe</code> and <code>notify</code> can trigger actions, not <code>require</code>,
so it only makes sense to use <code>refreshonly</code> with <code>subscribe</code> or <code>notify</code>.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### returns

<p>The expected return code(s).  An error will be returned if the
executed command returns something else.  Defaults to 0. Can be
specified as an array of acceptable return codes or a single value.</p>


##### timeout

<p>The maximum time the command should take.  If the command takes
longer than the timeout, the command is considered to have failed
and will be stopped.  Use any negative number to disable the timeout.
The time is specified in seconds.</p>


##### unless

<p>If this parameter is set, then this <code>exec</code> will run unless
the command returns 0.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>
exec { &quot;/bin/echo root &gt;&gt; /usr/lib/cron/cron.allow&quot;:
    path =&gt; &quot;/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin&quot;,
    unless =&gt; &quot;grep root /usr/lib/cron/cron.allow 2&gt;/dev/null&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This would add <code>root</code> to the cron.allow file (on Solaris) unless
<code>grep</code> determines it's already there.</p>
<p>Note that this command follows the same rules as the main command,
which is to say that it must be fully qualified if the path is not set.</p>


##### user

<p>The user to run the command as.  Note that if you
use this then any error output is not currently captured.  This
is because of a bug within Ruby.  If you are using Puppet to
create this user, the exec will automatically require the user,
as long as it is specified by name.</p>
<p>Please also note that $HOME is not set when using this option.</p>



<hr />

### file

<p>Manages local files, including setting ownership and
permissions, creation of both files and directories, and
retrieving entire files from remote servers.  As Puppet matures, it
expected that the <code>file</code> resource will be used less and less to
manage content, and instead native resources will be used to do so.</p>
<p>If you find that you are often copying files in from a central
location, rather than using native resources, please contact
Puppet Labs and we can hopefully work with you to develop a
native resource to support what you are doing.</p>

#### Parameters


##### backup

<p>Whether files should be backed up before
being replaced.  The preferred method of backing files up is via
a <code>filebucket</code>, which stores files by their MD5 sums and allows
easy retrieval without littering directories with backups.  You
can specify a local filebucket or a network-accessible
server-based filebucket by setting <code>backup =&gt; bucket-name</code>.
Alternatively, if you specify any value that begins with a <code>.</code>
(e.g., <code>.puppet-bak</code>), then Puppet will use copy the file in
the same directory with that value as the extension of the
backup. Setting <code>backup =&gt; false</code> disables all backups of the
file in question.</p>
<p>Puppet automatically creates a local filebucket named <code>puppet</code> and
defaults to backing up there.  To use a server-based filebucket,
you must specify one in your configuration:</p>
<pre><code>
filebucket { main:
    server =&gt; puppet
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>puppetmasterd</code> daemon creates a filebucket by default,
so you can usually back up to your main server with this
configuration.  Once you've described the bucket in your
configuration, you can use it in any file:</p>
<pre><code>
file { &quot;/my/file&quot;:
    source =&gt; &quot;/path/in/nfs/or/something&quot;,
    backup =&gt; main
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will back the file up to the central server.</p>
<p>At this point, the benefits of using a filebucket are that you do not
have backup files lying around on each of your machines, a given
version of a file is only backed up once, and you can restore
any given file manually, no matter how old.  Eventually,
transactional support will be able to automatically restore
filebucketed files.</p>


##### checksum

<p>How to check whether a file has changed.  This state is used internally
for file copying, but it can also be used to monitor files somewhat
like Tripwire without managing the file contents in any way.  You can
specify that a file's checksum should be monitored and then subscribe to
the file from another object and receive events to signify
checksum changes, for instance.</p>
<p>There are a number of checksum types available including MD5 hashing (and
an md5lite variation that only hashes the first 500 characters of the
file.</p>
<p>The default checksum parameter, if checksums are enabled, is md5.  Valid values are <code>md5</code>, <code>md5lite</code>, <code>timestamp</code>, <code>mtime</code>, <code>time</code>, <code>none</code>.  Values can match <code>/^\{md5|md5lite|timestamp|mtime|time|none\}/</code>.</p>


##### content

<p>Specify the contents of a file as a string.  Newlines, tabs, and
spaces can be specified using the escaped syntax (e.g., n for a
newline).  The primary purpose of this parameter is to provide a
kind of limited templating:</p>
<pre><code>
define resolve(nameserver1, nameserver2, domain, search) {
    $str = &quot;search $search
domain $domain
nameserver $nameserver1
nameserver $nameserver2
&quot;

    file { &quot;/etc/resolv.conf&quot;:
        content =&gt; $str
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This attribute is especially useful when used with
templating.</p>


##### ensure

<p>Whether to create files that don't currently exist.
Possible values are <em>absent</em>, <em>present</em>, <em>file</em>, and <em>directory</em>.
Specifying <code>present</code> will match any form of file existence, and
if the file is missing will create an empty file. Specifying
<code>absent</code> will delete the file (and directory if recurse =&gt; true).</p>
<p>Anything other than those values will be considered to be a symlink.
For instance, the following text creates a link:</p>
<pre><code>
# Useful on solaris
file { &quot;/etc/inetd.conf&quot;:
    ensure =&gt; &quot;/etc/inet/inetd.conf&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can make relative links:</p>
<pre><code>
# Useful on solaris
file { &quot;/etc/inetd.conf&quot;:
    ensure =&gt; &quot;inet/inetd.conf&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to make a relative link to a file named the same
as one of the valid values, you must prefix it with <code>./</code> or
something similar.</p>
<p>You can also make recursive symlinks, which will create a
directory structure that maps to the target directory,
with directories corresponding to each directory
and links corresponding to each file.  Valid values are <code>absent</code> (also called <code>false</code>), <code>file</code>, <code>present</code>, <code>directory</code>, <code>link</code>.  Values can match <code>/./</code>.</p>


##### force

<p>Force the file operation.  Currently only used when replacing
directories with links.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### group

<p>Which group should own the file.  Argument can be either group
name or group ID.</p>


##### ignore

<p>A parameter which omits action on files matching
specified patterns during recursion.  Uses Ruby's builtin globbing
engine, so shell metacharacters are fully supported, e.g. <code>[a-z]*</code>.
Matches that would descend into the directory structure are ignored,
e.g., <code>*/*</code>.</p>


##### links

<p>How to handle links during file actions.  During file copying,
<code>follow</code> will copy the target file instead of the link, <code>manage</code>
will copy the link itself, and <code>ignore</code> will just pass it by.
When not copying, <code>manage</code> and <code>ignore</code> behave equivalently
(because you cannot really ignore links entirely during local
recursion), and <code>follow</code> will manage the file to which the
link points.  Valid values are <code>follow</code>, <code>manage</code>.</p>


##### mode

<p>Mode the file should be.  Currently relatively limited:
you must specify the exact mode the file should be.</p>
<p>Note that when you set the mode of a directory, Puppet always
sets the search/traverse (1) bit anywhere the read (4) bit is set.
This is almost always what you want: read allows you to list the
entries in a directory, and search/traverse allows you to access
(read/write/execute) those entries.)  Because of this feature, you
can recursively make a directory and all of the files in it
world-readable by setting e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>
file { '/some/dir':
  mode =&gt; 644,
  recurse =&gt; true,
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case all of the files underneath <code>/some/dir</code> will have
mode 644, and all of the directories will have mode 755.</p>


##### owner

<p>To whom the file should belong.  Argument can be user name or
user ID.</p>


##### path

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The path to the file to manage.  Must be fully qualified.</p>


##### purge

<p>Whether unmanaged files should be purged.  If you have a filebucket
configured the purged files will be uploaded, but if you do not,
this will destroy data.  Only use this option for generated
files unless you really know what you are doing.  This option only
makes sense when recursively managing directories.</p>
<p>Note that when using <code>purge</code> with <code>source</code>, Puppet will purge any files
that are not on the remote system.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### recurse

<p>Whether and how deeply to do recursive
management.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>inf</code>, <code>remote</code>.  Values can match <code>/^[0-9]+$/</code>.</p>


##### recurselimit

<p>How deeply to do recursive management.  Values can match <code>/^[0-9]+$/</code>.</p>


##### replace

<p>Whether or not to replace a file that is
sourced but exists.  This is useful for using file sources
purely for initialization.  Valid values are <code>true</code> (also called <code>yes</code>), <code>false</code> (also called <code>no</code>).</p>


##### selrange

<p>What the SELinux range component of the context of the file should be.
Any valid SELinux range component is accepted.  For example <code>s0</code> or
<code>SystemHigh</code>.  If not specified it defaults to the value returned by
matchpathcon for the file, if any exists.  Only valid on systems with
SELinux support enabled and that have support for MCS (Multi-Category
Security).</p>


##### selrole

<p>What the SELinux role component of the context of the file should be.
Any valid SELinux role component is accepted.  For example <code>role_r</code>.
If not specified it defaults to the value returned by matchpathcon for
the file, if any exists.  Only valid on systems with SELinux support
enabled.</p>


##### seltype

<p>What the SELinux type component of the context of the file should be.
Any valid SELinux type component is accepted.  For example <code>tmp_t</code>.
If not specified it defaults to the value returned by matchpathcon for
the file, if any exists.  Only valid on systems with SELinux support
enabled.</p>


##### seluser

<p>What the SELinux user component of the context of the file should be.
Any valid SELinux user component is accepted.  For example <code>user_u</code>.
If not specified it defaults to the value returned by matchpathcon for
the file, if any exists.  Only valid on systems with SELinux support
enabled.</p>


##### source

<p>Copy a file over the current file.  Uses <code>checksum</code> to
determine when a file should be copied.  Valid values are either
fully qualified paths to files, or URIs.  Currently supported URI
types are <em>puppet</em> and <em>file</em>.</p>
<p>This is one of the primary mechanisms for getting content into
applications that Puppet does not directly support and is very
useful for those configuration files that don't change much across
sytems.  For instance:</p>
<pre><code>
class sendmail {
    file { &quot;/etc/mail/sendmail.cf&quot;:
        source =&gt; &quot;puppet://server/modules/module_name/sendmail.cf&quot;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can also leave out the server name, in which case <code>puppetd</code>
will fill in the name of its configuration server and <code>puppet</code>
will use the local filesystem.  This makes it easy to use the same
configuration in both local and centralized forms.</p>
<p>Currently, only the <code>puppet</code> scheme is supported for source
URL's. Puppet will connect to the file server running on
<code>server</code> to retrieve the contents of the file. If the
<code>server</code> part is empty, the behavior of the command-line
interpreter (<code>puppet</code>) and the client demon (<code>puppetd</code>) differs
slightly: <code>puppet</code> will look such a file up on the module path
on the local host, whereas <code>puppetd</code> will connect to the
puppet server that it received the manifest from.</p>
<p>See the fileserver configuration documentation for information on how to configure
and use file services within Puppet.</p>
<p>If you specify multiple file sources for a file, then the first
source that exists will be used.  This allows you to specify
what amount to search paths for files:</p>
<pre><code>
file { &quot;/path/to/my/file&quot;:
    source =&gt; [
        &quot;/modules/nfs/files/file.$host&quot;,
        &quot;/modules/nfs/files/file.$operatingsystem&quot;,
        &quot;/modules/nfs/files/file&quot;
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will use the first found file as the source.</p>
<p>You cannot currently copy links using this mechanism; set <code>links</code>
to <code>follow</code> if any remote sources are links.</p>


##### sourceselect

<p>Whether to copy all valid sources, or just the first one.  This parameter
is only used in recursive copies; by default, the first valid source is the
only one used as a recursive source, but if this parameter is set to <code>all</code>,
then all valid sources will have all of their contents copied to the local host,
and for sources that have the same file, the source earlier in the list will
be used.  Valid values are <code>first</code>, <code>all</code>.</p>


##### target

<p>The target for creating a link.  Currently, symlinks are the
only type supported.  Valid values are <code>notlink</code>.  Values can match <code>/./</code>.</p>


##### type

<p>A read-only state to check the file type.</p>



<hr />

### filebucket

<p>A repository for backing up files.  If no filebucket is
defined, then files will be backed up in their current directory,
but the filebucket can be either a host- or site-global repository
for backing up.  It stores files and returns the MD5 sum, which
can later be used to retrieve the file if restoration becomes
necessary.  A filebucket does not do any work itself; instead,
it can be specified as the value of <em>backup</em> in a <strong>file</strong> object.</p>
<p>Currently, filebuckets are only useful for manual retrieval of
accidentally removed files (e.g., you look in the log for the md5
sum and retrieve the file with that sum from the filebucket), but
when transactions are fully supported filebuckets will be used to
undo transactions.</p>
<p>You will normally want to define a single filebucket for your
whole network and then use that as the default backup location:</p>
<pre><code>
# Define the bucket
filebucket { main: server =&gt; puppet }

# Specify it as the default target
File { backup =&gt; main }
</code></pre>
<p>Puppetmaster servers create a filebucket by default, so this will
work in a default configuration.</p>

#### Parameters


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the filebucket.</p>


##### path

<p>The path to the local filebucket.  If this is
unset, then the bucket is remote.  The parameter <em>server</em> must
can be specified to set the remote server.</p>


##### port

<p>The port on which the remote server is listening.
Defaults to the normal Puppet port, 8140.</p>


##### server

<p>The server providing the remote filebucket.  If this is not
specified then <em>path</em> is checked. If it is set, then the
bucket is local.  Otherwise the puppetmaster server specified
in the config or at the commandline is used.</p>



<hr />

### group

<p>Manage groups. On most platforms this can only create groups.
Group membership must be managed on individual users.</p>
<p>On some platforms such as OS X, group membership is managed as an
attribute of the group, not the user record. Providers must have
the feature 'manages_members' to manage the 'members' property of
a group record.</p>

#### Features

<ul>
<li><strong>manages_members</strong>: For directories where membership is an attribute of groups not users.</li>
</ul>

#### Parameters


##### allowdupe

<p>Whether to allow duplicate GIDs.  This option does not work on
FreeBSD (contract to the <code>pw</code> man page).  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### auth_membership

<p>whether the provider is authoritative for group membership.</p>


##### ensure

<p>Create or remove the group.  Valid values are <code>present</code>, <code>absent</code>.</p>


##### gid

<p>The group ID.  Must be specified numerically.  If not
specified, a number will be picked, which can result in ID
differences across systems and thus is not recommended.  The
GID is picked according to local system standards.</p>


##### members

<p>The members of the group. For directory services where group
membership is stored in the group objects, not the users.  Requires features manages_members.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The group name.  While naming limitations vary by
system, it is advisable to keep the name to the degenerate
limitations, which is a maximum of 8 characters beginning with
a letter.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>directoryservice</strong>: Group management using DirectoryService on OS X.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Required binaries: <code>/usr/bin/dscl</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>darwin</code>.    Supported features: <code>manages_members</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>groupadd</strong>: Group management via <code>groupadd</code> and its ilk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default for most platforms</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Required binaries: <code>groupdel</code>, <code>groupmod</code>, <code>groupadd</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>ldap</strong>: Group management via <code>ldap</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This provider requires that you have valid values for all of the
ldap-related settings, including <code>ldapbase</code>.  You will also almost
definitely need settings for <code>ldapuser</code> and <code>ldappassword</code>, so that
your clients can write to ldap.</p>
<p>Note that this provider will automatically generate a GID for you if you do
not specify one, but it is a potentially expensive operation, as it
iterates across all existing groups to pick the appropriate next one.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>pw</strong>: Group management via <code>pw</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only works on FreeBSD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Required binaries: <code>/usr/sbin/pw</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>freebsd</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<hr />

### macauthorization

<p>Manage the Mac OS X authorization database.
See:
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/Conceptual/Security_Overview/Security_Services/chapter_4_section_5.html">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/Conceptual/Security_Overview/Security_Services/chapter_4_section_5.html</a> for more information.</p>

#### Parameters


##### allow_root

<p>Corresponds to 'allow-root' in the authorization store, renamed
due to hyphens being problematic. Specifies whether a right should be
allowed automatically if the requesting process is running with
uid == 0.  AuthorizationServices defaults this attribute to false if
not specified  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### auth_class

<p>Corresponds to 'class' in the authorization store, renamed due
to 'class' being a reserved word.  Valid values are <code>user</code>, <code>evaluate-mechanisms</code>, <code>allow</code>, <code>deny</code>, <code>rule</code>.</p>


##### auth_type

<p>type - can be a 'right' or a 'rule'. 'comment' has not yet been
implemented.  Valid values are <code>right</code>, <code>rule</code>.</p>


##### authenticate_user

<p>Corresponds to 'authenticate-user' in the authorization store,
renamed due to hyphens being problematic.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### comment

<p>The 'comment' attribute for authorization resources.</p>


##### ensure

<p>The basic property that the resource should be in.  Valid values are <code>present</code>, <code>absent</code>.</p>


##### group

<p>The user must authenticate as a member of this group. This
attribute can be set to any one group.</p>


##### k_of_n

<p>k-of-n describes how large a subset of rule mechanisms must
succeed for successful authentication. If there are 'n' mechanisms,
then 'k' (the integer value of this parameter) mechanisms must succeed.
The most common setting for this parameter is '1'. If k-of-n is not
set, then 'n-of-n' mechanisms must succeed.</p>


##### mechanisms

<p>an array of suitable mechanisms.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the right or rule to be managed.
Corresponds to 'key' in Authorization Services. The key is the name
of a rule. A key uses the same naming conventions as a right. The
Security Server uses a rule’s key to match the rule with a right.
Wildcard keys end with a ‘.’. The generic rule has an empty key value.
Any rights that do not match a specific rule use the generic rule.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>macauthorization</strong>: Manage Mac OS X authorization database rules and rights.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Required binaries: <code>/usr/bin/security</code>, <code>/usr/bin/sw_vers</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>darwin</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>


##### rule

<p>The rule(s) that this right refers to.</p>


##### session_owner

<p>Corresponds to 'session-owner' in the authorization store,
renamed due to hyphens being problematic.  Whether the session owner
automatically matches this rule or right.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### shared

<p>If this is set to true, then the Security Server marks the
credentials used to gain this right as shared. The Security Server
may use any shared credentials to authorize this right. For maximum
security, set sharing to false so credentials stored by the Security
Server for one application may not be used by another application.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### timeout

<p>The credential used by this rule expires in the specified
number of seconds. For maximum security where the user must
authenticate every time, set the timeout to 0. For minimum security,
remove the timeout attribute so the user authenticates only once per
session.</p>


##### tries

<p>The number of tries allowed.</p>



<hr />

### mcx

<p>MCX object management using DirectoryService on OS X.</p>
<p>Original Author: Jeff McCune &lt;<a href="mailto:mccune.jeff&#64;gmail.com">mccune.jeff&#64;gmail.com</a>&gt;</p>
<p>The default provider of this type merely manages the XML plist as
reported by the dscl -mcxexport command.  This is similar to the
content property of the file type in Puppet.</p>
<p>The recommended method of using this type is to use Work Group Manager
to manage users and groups on the local computer, record the resulting
puppet manifest using the command 'ralsh mcx' then deploying this
to other machines.</p>

#### Features

<ul>
<li><strong>manages_content</strong>: The provider can manage MCXSettings as a string.</li>
</ul>
<table border="1">
<colgroup>
<col width="40%" />
<col width="60%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr><th>Provider</th>
<th>manages_content</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>mcxcontent</td>
<td><strong>X</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


#### Parameters


##### content

<p>The XML Plist.  The value of MCXSettings in DirectoryService.
This is the standard output from the system command:
dscl localhost -mcxexport /Local/Default/&lt;ds_type&gt;/&lt;ds_name&gt;
Note that ds_type is capitalized and plural in the dscl command.  Requires features manages_content.</p>


##### ds_name

<p>The name to attach the MCX Setting to.
e.g. 'localhost' when ds_type =&gt; computer. This setting is not
required, as it may be parsed so long as the resource name is
parseable.  e.g. /Groups/admin where 'group' is the dstype.</p>


##### ds_type

<p>The DirectoryService type this MCX setting attaches to.  Valid values are <code>user</code>, <code>group</code>, <code>computer</code>, <code>computerlist</code>.</p>


##### ensure

<p>Create or remove the MCX setting.  Valid values are <code>present</code>, <code>absent</code>.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the resource being managed.
The default naming convention follows Directory Service paths:</p>
<pre><code>
/Computers/localhost
/Groups/admin
/Users/localadmin
</code></pre>
<p>The ds_type and ds_name type parameters are not necessary if the
default naming convention is followed.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>mcxcontent</strong>: MCX Settings management using DirectoryService on OS X.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This provider manages the entire MCXSettings attribute available
to some directory services nodes.  This management is 'all or nothing'
in that discrete application domain key value pairs are not managed
by this provider.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use WorkGroup Manager to configure Users, Groups,
Computers, or ComputerLists, then use 'ralsh mcx' to generate a puppet
manifest from the resulting configuration.</p>
<p>Original Author: Jeff McCune (<a href="mailto:mccune.jeff&#64;gmail.com">mccune.jeff&#64;gmail.com</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Required binaries: <code>/usr/bin/dscl</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>darwin</code>.    Supported features: <code>manages_content</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>



<hr />

### mount

<p>Manages mounted filesystems, including putting mount
information into the mount table. The actual behavior depends
on the value of the 'ensure' parameter.</p>
<p>Note that if a <code>mount</code> receives an event from another resource,
it will try to remount the filesystems if <code>ensure</code> is set to <code>mounted</code>.</p>

#### Features

<ul>
<li><strong>refreshable</strong>: The provider can remount the filesystem.</li>
</ul>
<table border="1">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


#### Parameters


##### atboot

<p>Whether to mount the mount at boot.  Not all platforms
support this.</p>


##### blockdevice

<p>The device to fsck.  This is property is only valid
on Solaris, and in most cases will default to the correct
value.</p>


##### device

<p>The device providing the mount.  This can be whatever
device is supporting by the mount, including network
devices or devices specified by UUID rather than device
path, depending on the operating system.</p>


##### dump

<p>Whether to dump the mount.  Not all platform support this.
Valid values are <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>. or <code>2</code> on FreeBSD, Default is <code>0</code>.  Values can match <code>/(0|1)/</code>, <code>/(0|1)/</code>.</p>


##### ensure

<p>Control what to do with this mount. Set this attribute to
<code>present</code> to make sure the filesystem is in the filesystem table
but not mounted (if the filesystem is currently mounted, it will be
unmounted).  Set it to <code>absent</code> to unmount (if necessary) and remove
the filesystem from the fstab.  Set to <code>mounted</code> to add it to the
fstab and mount it.  Valid values are <code>present</code> (also called <code>unmounted</code>), <code>absent</code>, <code>mounted</code>.</p>


##### fstype

<p>The mount type.  Valid values depend on the
operating system.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The mount path for the mount.</p>


##### options

<p>Mount options for the mounts, as they would

##### path

<p>The deprecated name for the mount point.  Please use <code>name</code> now.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>parsed</strong>:   Required binaries: <code>umount</code>, <code>mount</code>.      Supported features: <code>refreshable</code>.</li>
</ul>


##### remounts

<p>Whether the mount can be remounted  <code>mount -o remount</code>.  If
this is false, then the filesystem will be unmounted and remounted
manually, which is prone to failure.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### target

<p>The file in which to store the mount table.  Only used by
those providers that write to disk.</p>



<hr />

### nagios_command

<p>The Nagios type command.  This resource type is autogenerated using the
model developed in <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/naginator">Naginator</a>, and all of the Nagios types are generated using the

<p>This type generates Nagios configuration statements in Nagios-parseable configuration
files.  By default, the statements will be added to <code>/etc/nagios/nagios_command.cfg</code>, but
you can send them to a different file by setting their <code>target</code> attribute.</p>
<p>You can purge Nagios resources using the <code>resources</code> type, but <em>only</em>
in the default file locations.  This is an architectural limitation.</p>

you can send them to a different file by setting their <code>target</code> attribute.</p>
<p>You can purge Nagios resources using the <code>resources</code> type, but <em>only</em>
in the default file locations.  This is an architectural limitation.</p>

### package

<p>Manage packages.  There is a basic dichotomy in package
support right now:  Some package types (e.g., yum and apt) can
retrieve their own package files, while others (e.g., rpm and
sun) cannot.  For those package formats that cannot retrieve
their own files, you can use the <code>source</code> parameter to point to
the correct file.</p>
<p>Puppet will automatically guess the packaging format that you are
using based on the platform you are on, but you can override it
using the <code>provider</code> parameter; each provider defines what it
requires in order to function, and you must meet those requirements
to use a given provider.</p>

#### Features

<ul>
<li><strong>installable</strong>: The provider can install packages.</li>
<li><strong>purgeable</strong>: The provider can purge packages.  This generally means that all traces of the package are removed, including existing configuration files.  This feature is thus destructive and should be used with the utmost care.</li>
<li><strong>uninstallable</strong>: The provider can uninstall packages.</li>
<li><strong>upgradeable</strong>: The provider can upgrade to the latest version of a package.  This feature is used by specifying <code>latest</code> as the desired value for the package.</li>
<li><strong>versionable</strong>: The provider is capable of interrogating the package database for installed version(s), and can select which out of a set of available versions of a package to install if asked.</li>

#### Parameters


##### adminfile

<p>A file containing package defaults for installing packages.
This is currently only used on Solaris.  The value will be
validated according to system rules, which in the case of
Solaris means that it should either be a fully qualified path
or it should be in /var/sadm/install/admin.</p>


##### allowcdrom

<p>Tells apt to allow cdrom sources in the sources.list file.
Normally apt will bail if you try this.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### category

<p>A read-only parameter set by the package.</p>


##### configfiles

<p>Whether configfiles should be kept or replaced.  Most packages
types do not support this parameter.  Valid values are <code>keep</code>, <code>replace</code>.</p>


##### description

<p>A read-only parameter set by the package.</p>


##### ensure

<p>What state the package should be in.
<em>latest</em> only makes sense for those packaging formats that can
retrieve new packages on their own and will throw an error on
those that cannot.  For those packaging systems that allow you
to specify package versions, specify them here.  Similarly,
<em>purged</em> is only useful for packaging systems that support
the notion of managing configuration files separately from
'normal' system files.  Valid values are <code>present</code> (also called <code>installed</code>), <code>absent</code>, <code>purged</code>, <code>latest</code>.  Values can match <code>/./</code>.</p>


##### instance

<p>A read-only parameter set by the package.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The package name.  This is the name that the packaging
system uses internally, which is sometimes (especially on Solaris)
a name that is basically useless to humans.  If you want to
abstract package installation, then you can use aliases to provide
a common name to packages:</p>
<pre><code>
# In the 'openssl' class
$ssl = $operatingsystem ? {
    solaris =&gt; SMCossl,
    default =&gt; openssl
}

# It is not an error to set an alias to the same value as the
# object name.
package { $ssl:
    ensure =&gt; installed,
    alias =&gt; openssl
}

. etc. .

$ssh = $operatingsystem ? {
    solaris =&gt; SMCossh,
    default =&gt; openssh
}

# Use the alias to specify a dependency, rather than
# having another selector to figure it out again.
package { $ssh:
    ensure =&gt; installed,
    alias =&gt; openssh,
    require =&gt; Package[openssl]
}
</code></pre>


##### platform

<p>A read-only parameter set by the package.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>appdmg</strong>: Package management which copies application bundles to a target.  Required binaries: <code>/usr/bin/curl</code>, <code>/usr/bin/ditto</code>, <code>/usr/bin/hdiutil</code>.      Supported features: <code>installable</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>apple</strong>: Package management based on OS X's builtin packaging system.  This is</dt>
<dd><p>essentially the simplest and least functional package system in existence --
it only supports installation; no deletion or upgrades.  The provider will
automatically add the <code>.pkg</code> extension, so leave that off when specifying
the package name.  Required binaries: <code>/usr/sbin/installer</code>.      Supported features: <code>installable</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p><strong>apt</strong>: Package management via <code>apt-get</code>.

</li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>freebsd</strong>: The specific form of package management on FreeBSD.  This is an</dt>
<dd><p>extremely quirky packaging system, in that it freely mixes between
ports and packages.  Apparently all of the tools are written in Ruby,

</li>
<li><p><strong>pkgdmg</strong>: Package management based on Apple's Installer.app and DiskUtility.app.  This package works by checking the contents of a DMG image for Apple pkg or mpkg files. Any number of pkg or mpkg files may exist in the root directory of the DMG file system. Sub directories are not checked for packages.  See <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Package_Management_With_Dmg_Patterns">the wiki docs for DMG packages</a> for more detail.

##### responsefile

<p>A file containing any necessary answers to questions asked by
the package.  This is currently used on Solaris and Debian.  The
value will be validated according to system rules, but it should
generally be a fully qualified path.</p>


##### root

<p>A read-only parameter set by the package.</p>


##### source

<p>Where to find the actual package.  This must be a local file
(or on a network file system) or a URL that your specific
packaging type understands; Puppet will not retrieve files for you.</p>


##### status

<p>A read-only parameter set by the package.</p>


##### type

<p>Deprecated form of <code>provider</code>.</p>


##### vendor

<p>A read-only parameter set by the package.</p>



<hr />

### resources

<p>This is a metatype that can manage other resource types.  Any
metaparams specified here will be passed on to any generated resources,
so you can purge umanaged resources but set <code>noop</code> to true so the
purging is only logged and does not actually happen.</p>

#### Parameters


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the type to be managed.</p>


##### purge

<p>Purge unmanaged resources.  This will delete any resource
that is not specified in your configuration
and is not required by any specified resources.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### unless_system_user

<p>This keeps system users from being purged.  By default, it
does not purge users whose UIDs are less than or equal to 500, but you can specify
a different UID as the inclusive limit.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.  Values can match <code>/^\d+$/</code>.</p>



<hr />

### schedule

<p>Defined schedules for Puppet.  The important thing to understand
about how schedules are currently implemented in Puppet is that they
can only be used to stop a resource from being applied, they never
guarantee that it is applied.</p>
<p>Every time Puppet applies its configuration, it will collect the
list of resources whose schedule does not eliminate them from
running right then, but there is currently no system in place to
guarantee that a given resource runs at a given time.  If you
specify a very  restrictive schedule and Puppet happens to run at a
time within that schedule, then the resources will get applied;
otherwise, that work may never get done.</p>
<p>Thus, it behooves you to use wider scheduling (e.g., over a couple of
hours) combined with periods and repetitions.  For instance, if you
wanted to restrict certain resources to only running once, between
the hours of two and 4 AM, then you would use this schedule:</p>
<pre><code>
schedule { maint:
    range =&gt; &quot;2 - 4&quot;,
    period =&gt; daily,
    repeat =&gt; 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>With this schedule, the first time that Puppet runs between 2 and 4 AM,
all resources with this schedule will get applied, but they won't
get applied again between 2 and 4 because they will have already
run once that day, and they won't get applied outside that schedule
because they will be outside the scheduled range.</p>
<p>Puppet automatically creates a schedule for each valid period with the
same name as that period (e.g., hourly and daily).  Additionally,
a schedule named <em>puppet</em> is created and used as the default,
with the following attributes:</p>
<pre><code>
schedule { puppet:
    period =&gt; hourly,
    repeat =&gt; 2
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will cause resources to be applied every 30 minutes by default.</p>

#### Parameters


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the schedule.  This name is used to retrieve the
schedule when assigning it to an object:</p>
<pre><code>
schedule { daily:
    period =&gt; daily,
    range =&gt; [2, 4]
}

exec { &quot;/usr/bin/apt-get update&quot;:
    schedule =&gt; daily
}
</code></pre>


##### period

<p>The period of repetition for a resource.  Choose from among
a fixed list of <em>hourly</em>, <em>daily</em>, <em>weekly</em>, and <em>monthly</em>.
The default is for a resource to get applied every time that
Puppet runs, whatever that period is.</p>
<p>Note that the period defines how often a given resource will get
applied but not when; if you would like to restrict the hours
that a given resource can be applied (e.g., only at night during
a maintenance window) then use the <code>range</code> attribute.</p>
<p>If the provided periods are not sufficient, you can provide a
value to the <em>repeat</em> attribute, which will cause Puppet to
schedule the affected resources evenly in the period the
specified number of times.  Take this schedule:</p>
<pre><code>
schedule { veryoften:
    period =&gt; hourly,
    repeat =&gt; 6
}
</code></pre>
<p>This can cause Puppet to apply that resource up to every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>At the moment, Puppet cannot guarantee that level of
repetition; that is, it can run up to every 10 minutes, but
internal factors might prevent it from actually running that
often (e.g., long-running Puppet runs will squash conflictingly
scheduled runs).</p>
<p>See the <code>periodmatch</code> attribute for tuning whether to match
times by their distance apart or by their specific value.  Valid values are <code>hourly</code>, <code>daily</code>, <code>weekly</code>, <code>monthly</code>, <code>never</code>.</p>


##### periodmatch

<p>Whether periods should be matched by number (e.g., the two times
are in the same hour) or by distance (e.g., the two times are
60 minutes apart).  Valid values are <code>number</code>, <code>distance</code>.</p>


##### range

<p>The earliest and latest that a resource can be applied.  This
is always a range within a 24 hour period, and hours must be
specified in numbers between 0 and 23, inclusive.  Minutes and
seconds can be provided, using the normal colon as a separator.
For instance:</p>
<pre><code>
schedule { maintenance:
    range =&gt; &quot;1:30 - 4:30&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is mostly useful for restricting certain resources to being
applied in maintenance windows or during off-peak hours.</p>


##### repeat

<p>How often the application gets repeated in a given period.
Defaults to 1. Must be an integer.</p>



<hr />

### selboolean

<p>Manages SELinux booleans on systems with SELinux support.  The supported booleans
are any of the ones found in /selinux/booleans/.</p>

#### Parameters


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the SELinux boolean to be managed.</p>


##### persistent

<p>If set true, SELinux booleans will be written to disk and persist accross reboots.
The default is <code>false</code>.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>getsetsebool</strong>: Manage SELinux booleans using the getsebool and setsebool binaries.  Required binaries: <code>/usr/sbin/getsebool</code>, <code>/usr/sbin/setsebool</code>.</li>
</ul>


##### value

<p>Whether the the SELinux boolean should be enabled or disabled.  Valid values are <code>on</code>, <code>off</code>.</p>



<hr />

### selmodule

<p>Manages loading and unloading of SELinux policy modules
on the system.  Requires SELinux support.  See man semodule(8)
for more information on SELinux policy modules.</p>

#### Parameters


##### ensure

<p>The basic property that the resource should be in.  Valid values are <code>present</code>, <code>absent</code>.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the SELinux policy to be managed.  You should not
include the customary trailing .pp extension.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>semodule</strong>: Manage SELinux policy modules using the semodule binary.  Required binaries: <code>/usr/sbin/semodule</code>.</li>
</ul>


##### selmoduledir

<p>The directory to look for the compiled pp module file in.
Currently defaults to /usr/share/selinux/targeted.  If selmodulepath
is not specified the module will be looked for in this directory in a
in a file called NAME.pp, where NAME is the value of the name parameter.</p>


##### selmodulepath

<p>The full path to the compiled .pp policy module.  You only need to use
this if the module file is not in the directory pointed at by selmoduledir.</p>


##### syncversion

<p>If set to <code>true</code>, the policy will be reloaded if the
version found in the on-disk file differs from the loaded
version.  If set to <code>false</code> (the default) the the only check
that will be made is if the policy is loaded at all or not.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>

### service

<p>Manage running services.  Service support unfortunately varies
widely by platform -- some platforms have very little if any
concept of a running service, and some have a very codified and
powerful concept.  Puppet's service support will generally be able
to make up for any inherent shortcomings (e.g., if there is no
'status' command, then Puppet will look in the process table for a
command matching the service name), but the more information you
can provide the better behaviour you will get.  Or, you can just
use a platform that has very good service support.</p>
<p>Note that if a <code>service</code> receives an event from another resource,
the service will get restarted. The actual command to restart the
service depends on the platform. You can provide a special command
for restarting with the <code>restart</code> attribute.</p>

#### Features

<ul>
<li><strong>controllable</strong>: The provider uses a control variable.</li>
<li><strong>enableable</strong>: The provider can enable and disable the service</li>
<li><strong>refreshable</strong>: The provider can restart the service.</li>

#### Parameters


##### binary

<p>The path to the daemon.  This is only used for
systems that do not support init scripts.  This binary will be
used to start the service if no <code>start</code> parameter is
provided.</p>


##### control

<p>The control variable used to manage services (originally for HP-UX).
Defaults to the upcased service name plus <code>START</code> replacing dots with
underscores, for those providers that support the <code>controllable</code> feature.</p>


##### enable

<p>Whether a service should be enabled to start at boot.
This property behaves quite differently depending on the platform;
wherever possible, it relies on local tools to enable or disable
a given service.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.  Requires features enableable.</p>


##### ensure

<p>Whether a service should be running.  Valid values are <code>stopped</code> (also called <code>false</code>), <code>running</code> (also called <code>true</code>).</p>


##### hasrestart

<p>Specify that an init script has a <code>restart</code> option.  Otherwise,
the init script's <code>stop</code> and <code>start</code> methods are used.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### hasstatus

<p>Declare the the service's init script has a
functional status command.  Based on testing, it was found
that a large number of init scripts on different platforms do
not support any kind of status command; thus, you must specify
manually whether the service you are running has such a
command (or you can specify a specific command using the
<code>status</code> parameter).</p>
<p>If you do not specify anything, then the service name will be
looked for in the process table.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### manifest

<p>Specify a command to config a service, or a path to a manifest to do so.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the service to run.  This name is used to find
the service in whatever service subsystem it is in.</p>


##### path

<p>The search path for finding init scripts.  Multiple values should
be separated by colons or provided as an array.</p>


##### pattern

<p>The pattern to search for in the process table.
This is used for stopping services on platforms that do not
support init scripts, and is also used for determining service
status on those service whose init scripts do not include a status
command.</p>
<p>If this is left unspecified and is needed to check the status
of a service, then the service name will be used instead.</p>
<p>The pattern can be a simple string or any legal Ruby pattern.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>base</strong>: The simplest form of service support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to specify enough about your service for this to work; the
minimum you can specify is a binary for starting the process, and this
same binary will be searched for in the process table to stop the
service.  It is preferable to specify start, stop, and status commands,
akin to how you would do so using <code>init</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Required binaries: <code>kill</code>.      Supported features: <code>refreshable</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>daemontools</strong>: Daemontools service management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This provider manages daemons running supervised by D.J.Bernstein daemontools.
It tries to detect the service directory, with by order of preference:</p>
<ul>
<li>/service</li>
<li>/etc/service</li>
<li>/var/lib/svscan</li>
</ul>
<p>The daemon directory should be placed in a directory that can be
by default in:</p>
<ul>
<li>/var/lib/service</li>
<li>/etc</li>
</ul>
<p>or this can be overriden in the service resource parameters:</p>
<pre><code>
service {
 &quot;myservice&quot;:
   provider =&gt; &quot;daemontools&quot;, path =&gt; &quot;/path/to/daemons&quot;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This provider supports out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>start/stop (mapped to enable/disable)</li>
<li>enable/disable</li>
<li>restart</li>
<li>status</li>
</ul>
<p>If a service has ensure =&gt; &quot;running&quot;, it will link /path/to/daemon to
/path/to/service, which will automatically enable the service.</p>
<p>If a service has ensure =&gt; &quot;stopped&quot;, it will only down the service, not
remove the /path/to/service link.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Required binaries: <code>/usr/bin/svc</code>, <code>/usr/bin/svstat</code>.      Supported features: <code>enableable</code>, <code>refreshable</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>debian</strong>: Debian's form of <code>init</code>-style management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only difference is that this supports service enabling and disabling
via <code>update-rc.d</code> and determines enabled status via <code>invoke-rc.d</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Required binaries: <code>/usr/sbin/update-rc.d</code>, <code>/usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>debianubuntu</code>.    Supported features: <code>enableable</code>, <code>refreshable</code>.</p>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>freebsd</strong>: FreeBSD's (and probably NetBSD?) form of <code>init</code>-style service management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uses <code>rc.conf.d</code> for service enabling and disabling.</p>
<p>Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>freebsd</code>.    Supported features: <code>enableable</code>, <code>refreshable</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>gentoo</strong>: Gentoo's form of <code>init</code>-style service management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uses <code>rc-update</code> for service enabling and disabling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Required binaries: <code>/sbin/rc-update</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>gentoo</code>.    Supported features: <code>enableable</code>, <code>refreshable</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>init</strong>: Standard init service management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This provider assumes that the init script has no <code>status</code> command,
because so few scripts do, so you need to either provide a status
command or specify via <code>hasstatus</code> that one already exists in the
init script.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Supported features: <code>refreshable</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>launchd</strong>: launchd service management framework.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This provider manages launchd jobs, the default service framework for
Mac OS X, that has also been open sourced by Apple for possible use on
other platforms.</p>

<dt>This provider reads plists out of the following directories:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons</li>
<li>/System/Library/LaunchAgents</li>
<li>/Library/LaunchDaemons</li>
<li>/Library/LaunchAgents</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and builds up a list of services based upon each plists &quot;Label&quot; entry.</p>

<li><p><strong>smf</strong>: Support for Sun's new Service Management Framework.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting a service is effectively equivalent to enabling it, so there is
only support for starting and stopping services, which also enables and

</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>


##### restart

<p>Specify a <em>restart</em> command manually.  If left
unspecified, the service will be stopped and then started.</p>


##### start

<p>Specify a <em>start</em> command manually.  Most service subsystems
support a <code>start</code> command, so this will not need to be
specified.</p>


##### status

<p>Specify a <em>status</em> command manually.  If left
unspecified, the status method will be determined
automatically, usually by looking for the service in the
process table.</p>


##### stop

<p>Specify a <em>stop</em> command manually.</p>



<hr />

### ssh_authorized_key

<p>Manages SSH authorized keys. Currently only type 2 keys are
supported.</p>

#### Parameters


##### ensure

<p>The basic property that the resource should be in.  Valid values are <code>present</code>, <code>absent</code>.</p>


##### key

<p>The key itself; generally a long string of hex digits.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The SSH key comment. This attribute is currently used as a
system-wide primary key and therefore has to be unique.</p>


##### options

<p>Key options, see sshd(8) for possible values. Multiple values
should be specified as an array.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>parsed</strong>: Parse and generate authorized_keys files for SSH.</li>
</ul>


##### target

<p>The absolute filename in which to store the SSH key. This
property is optional and should only be used in cases where keys
are stored in a non-standard location (ie not in
~user/.ssh/authorized_keys).</p>


##### type

<p>The encryption type used: ssh-dss or ssh-rsa.  Valid values are <code>ssh-dss</code> (also called <code>dsa</code>), <code>ssh-rsa</code> (also called <code>rsa</code>).</p>


##### user

<p>The user account in which the SSH key should be installed.
The resource will automatically depend on this user.</p>



<hr />

### sshkey

<p>Installs and manages ssh host keys.  At this point, this type
only knows how to install keys into /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts, and
it cannot manage user authorized keys yet.</p>

#### Parameters


##### ensure

<p>The basic property that the resource should be in.  Valid values are <code>present</code>, <code>absent</code>.</p>


##### host_aliases

<p>Any aliases the host might have.  Multiple values must be
specified as an array.  Note that this property is not the same as
the &quot;alias&quot; metaparam; use this property to add aliases to a host
on disk, and &quot;alias&quot; to aliases for use in your Puppet scripts.</p>


##### key

<p>The key itself; generally a long string of hex digits.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The host name that the key is associated with.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>parsed</strong>: Parse and generate host-wide known hosts files for SSH.</li>
</ul>


##### target

<p>The file in which to store the ssh key.  Only used by
the <code>parsed</code> provider.</p>


##### type

<p>The encryption type used.  Probably ssh-dss or ssh-rsa.  Valid values are <code>ssh-dss</code> (also called <code>dsa</code>), <code>ssh-rsa</code> (also called <code>rsa</code>).</p>



<hr />

### tidy

<p>Remove unwanted files based on specific criteria.  Multiple
criteria are OR'd together, so a file that is too large but is not
old enough will still get tidied.</p>
<p>If you don't specify either 'age' or 'size', then all files will
be removed.</p>
<p>This resource type works by generating a file resource for every file
that should be deleted and then letting that resource perform the
actual deletion.</p>

#### Parameters


##### age

<p>Tidy files whose age is equal to or greater than
the specified time.  You can choose seconds, minutes,
hours, days, or weeks by specifying the first letter of any
of those words (e.g., '1w').</p>
<p>Specifying 0 will remove all files.</p>


##### backup

<p>Whether tidied files should be backed up.  Any values are passed
directly to the file resources used for actual file deletion, so use
its backup documentation to determine valid values.</p>


##### matches

<p>One or more (shell type) file glob patterns, which restrict
the list of files to be tidied to those whose basenames match
at least one of the patterns specified. Multiple patterns can
be specified using an array.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
tidy { &quot;/tmp&quot;:
    age =&gt; &quot;1w&quot;,
    recurse =&gt; 1,
    matches =&gt; [ &quot;[0-9]pub*.tmp&quot;, &quot;*.temp&quot;, &quot;tmpfile?&quot; ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This removes files from /tmp if they are one week old or older,
are not in a subdirectory and match one of the shell globs given.</p>
<p>Note that the patterns are matched against the basename of each
file -- that is, your glob patterns should not have any '/'
characters in them, since you are only specifying against the last
bit of the file.</p>
<p>Finally, note that you must now specify a non-zero/non-false value
for recurse if matches is used, as matches only apply to files found
by recursion (there's no reason to use static patterns match against
a statically determined path).  Requiering explicit recursion clears
up a common source of confusion.</p>


##### path

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The path to the file or directory to manage.  Must be fully
qualified.</p>


##### recurse

<p>If target is a directory, recursively descend
into the directory looking for files to tidy.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>inf</code>.  Values can match <code>/^[0-9]+$/</code>.</p>


##### rmdirs

<p>Tidy directories in addition to files; that is, remove
directories whose age is older than the specified criteria.
This will only remove empty directories, so all contained
files must also be tidied before a directory gets removed.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### size

<p>Tidy files whose size is equal to or greater than
the specified size.  Unqualified values are in kilobytes, but
<em>b</em>, <em>k</em>, and <em>m</em> can be appended to specify <em>bytes</em>, <em>kilobytes</em>,
and <em>megabytes</em>, respectively.  Only the first character is
significant, so the full word can also be used.</p>


##### type

<p>Set the mechanism for determining age.  Valid values are <code>atime</code>, <code>mtime</code>, <code>ctime</code>.</p>



<hr />

### user

<p>Manage users.  This type is mostly built to manage system
users, so it is lacking some features useful for managing normal
users.</p>
<p>This resource type uses the prescribed native tools for creating
groups and generally uses POSIX APIs for retrieving information
about them.  It does not directly modify /etc/passwd or anything.</p>

#### Features

<ul>
<li><strong>allows_duplicates</strong>: The provider supports duplicate users with the same UID.</li>
<li><strong>manages_homedir</strong>: The provider can create and remove home directories.</li>
<li><strong>manages_passwords</strong>: The provider can modify user passwords, by accepting a password hash.</li>
<li><strong>manages_solaris_rbac</strong>: The provider can manage roles and normal users</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>directoryservice</strong>: User management using DirectoryService on OS X.  Required binaries: <code>/usr/bin/dscl</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>darwin</code>.    Supported features: <code>manages_passwords</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>hpuxuseradd</strong>: User management for hp-ux! Undocumented switch to special usermod because HP-UX regular usermod is TOO STUPID to change stuff while the user is logged in.  Required binaries: <code>/usr/sam/lbin/userdel.sam</code>, <code>/usr/sam/lbin/usermod.sam</code>, <code>/usr/sbin/useradd</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>hp-ux</code>.    Supported features: <code>allows_duplicates</code>, <code>manages_homedir</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>ldap</strong>: User management via <code>ldap</code>.  This provider requires that you</dt>
<dd><p>have valid values for all of the ldap-related settings,
including <code>ldapbase</code>.  You will also almost definitely need settings
for <code>ldapuser</code> and <code>ldappassword</code>, so that your clients can write
to ldap.</p>
<p>Note that this provider will automatically generate a UID for you if
you do not specify one, but it is a potentially expensive operation,
as it iterates across all existing users to pick the appropriate next
one.      Supported features: <code>manages_passwords</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p><strong>pw</strong>: User management via <code>pw</code> on FreeBSD.  Required binaries: <code>pw</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>freebsd</code>.    Supported features: <code>allows_duplicates</code>, <code>manages_homedir</code>.</p>

<li><p><strong>useradd</strong>: User management via <code>useradd</code> and its ilk.  Note that you will need to install the <code>Shadow Password</code> Ruby library often known as ruby-libshadow to manage user passwords.  Required binaries: <code>userdel</code>, <code>usermod</code>, <code>useradd</code>.      Supported features: <code>allows_duplicates</code>, <code>manages_homedir</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>


##### role_membership

<p>Whether specified roles should be treated as the only roles
of which the user is a member or whether they should merely
be treated as the minimum membership list.  Valid values are <code>inclusive</code>, <code>minimum</code>.</p>


##### roles

<p>The roles the user has.  Multiple roles should be
specified as an array.  Requires features manages_solaris_rbac.</p>


##### shell

<p>The user's login shell.  The shell must exist and be
executable.</p>


##### uid

<p>The user ID.  Must be specified numerically.  For new users
being created, if no user ID is specified then one will be
chosen automatically, which will likely result in the same user
having different IDs on different systems, which is not
recommended.  This is especially noteworthy if you use Puppet
to manage the same user on both Darwin and other platforms,
since Puppet does the ID generation for you on Darwin, but the
tools do so on other platforms.</p>

<p>The basic property that the resource should be in.  Valid values are <code>present</code>, <code>absent</code>.</p>


##### mountpoint

<p>The mountpoint property.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The full name for this filesystem. (including the zpool)</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>solaris</strong>: Provider for Solaris zfs.  Required binaries: <code>/usr/sbin/zfs</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>solaris</code>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

### zone

<p>Solaris zones.</p>

#### Parameters


##### autoboot

<p>Whether the zone should automatically boot.  Valid values are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>.</p>


##### create_args

<p>Arguments to the zonecfg create command.  This can be used to create branded zones.</p>


##### ensure

<p>The running state of the zone.  The valid states directly reflect
the states that <code>zoneadm</code> provides.  The states are linear,
in that a zone must be <code>configured</code> then <code>installed</code>, and
only then can be <code>running</code>.  Note also that <code>halt</code> is currently
used to stop zones.</p>


##### id

<p>The numerical ID of the zone.  This number is autogenerated
and cannot be changed.</p>


##### inherit

<p>The list of directories that the zone inherits from the global
zone.  All directories must be fully qualified.</p>


##### install_args

<p>Arguments to the zoneadm install command.  This can be used to create branded zones.</p>


##### ip

<p>The IP address of the zone.  IP addresses must be specified
with the interface, separated by a colon, e.g.: bge0:192.168.0.1.
For multiple interfaces, specify them in an array.</p>


##### name

<ul>
<li><strong>namevar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the zone.</p>


##### path

<p>The root of the zone's filesystem.  Must be a fully qualified
file name.  If you include '%s' in the path, then it will be
replaced with the zone's name.  At this point, you cannot use
Puppet to move a zone.</p>


##### pool

<p>The resource pool for this zone.</p>


##### provider

<p>The specific backend for provider to use. You will
seldom need to specify this -- Puppet will usually discover the
appropriate provider for your platform.  Available providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>solaris</strong>: Provider for Solaris Zones.  Required binaries: <code>/usr/sbin/zoneadm</code>, <code>/usr/sbin/zonecfg</code>.    Default for <code>operatingsystem</code> == <code>solaris</code>.</li>
</ul>


##### realhostname

<p>The actual hostname of the zone.</p>


##### shares

<p>Number of FSS CPU shares allocated to the zone.</p>


##### sysidcfg

<p>The text to go into the sysidcfg file when the zone is first
booted.  The best way is to use a template:</p>
<pre><code>
# $templatedir/sysidcfg
system_locale=en_US
timezone=GMT
terminal=xterms
security_policy=NONE
root_password=&amp;lt;%= password %&gt;
timeserver=localhost
name_service=DNS {domain_name=&amp;lt;%= domain %&gt;
        name_server=&amp;lt;%= nameserver %&gt;}
network_interface=primary {hostname=&amp;lt;%= realhostname %&gt;
        ip_address=&amp;lt;%= ip %&gt;
        netmask=&amp;lt;%= netmask %&gt;
        protocol_ipv6=no
        default_route=&amp;lt;%= defaultroute %&gt;}
nfs4_domain=dynamic
</code></pre>
<p>And then call that:</p>
<pre><code>
zone { myzone:
    ip =&gt; &quot;bge0:192.168.0.23&quot;,
    sysidcfg =&gt; template(sysidcfg),
    path =&gt; &quot;/opt/zones/myzone&quot;,
    realhostname =&gt; &quot;fully.qualified.domain.name&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The sysidcfg only matters on the first booting of the zone,
so Puppet only checks for it at that time.</p>
