        "text": "Executes external commands.\n\nAny command in an `exec` resource **must** be able to run multiple times\nwithout causing harm --- that is, it must be *idempotent*. There are three\nmain ways for an exec to be idempotent:\n\n* The command itself is already idempotent. (For example, `apt-get update`.)\n* The exec has an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` attribute, which prevents\n  Puppet from running the command unless some condition is met.\n* The exec has `refreshonly => true`, which only allows Puppet to run the\n  command when some other resource is changed. (See the notes on refreshing\n  below.)\n\nA caution: There's a widespread tendency to use collections of execs to\nmanage resources that aren't covered by an existing resource type. This\nworks fine for simple tasks, but once your exec pile gets complex enough\nthat you really have to think to understand what's happening, you should\nconsider developing a custom resource type instead, as it will be much\nmore predictable and maintainable.\n\n**Refresh:** `exec` resources can respond to refresh events (via\n`notify`, `subscribe`, or the `~>` arrow). The refresh behavior of execs\nis non-standard, and can be affected by the `refresh` and\n`refreshonly` attributes:\n\n* If `refreshonly` is set to true, the exec will _only_ run when it receives an\n  event. This is the most reliable way to use refresh with execs.\n* If the exec already would have run and receives an event, it will run its\n  command **up to two times.** (If an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` condition\n  is no longer met after the first run, the second run will not occur.)\n* If the exec already would have run, has a `refresh` command, and receives an\n  event, it will run its normal command, then run its `refresh` command\n  (as long as any `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` conditions are still met\n  after the normal command finishes).\n* If the exec would **not** have run (due to an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates`\n  attribute) and receives an event, it still will not run.\n* If the exec has `noop => true`, would otherwise have run, and receives\n  an event from a non-noop resource, it will run once (or run its `refresh`\n  command instead, if it has one).\n\nIn short: If there's a possibility of your exec receiving refresh events,\nit becomes doubly important to make sure the run conditions are restricted.\n\n**Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing an exec's cwd or the executable\nfile used in an exec's command, the exec resource will autorequire those\nfiles. If Puppet is managing the user that an exec should run as, the\nexec resource will autorequire that user."

For instance, if you\nwanted to restrict certain resources to only running once, between\nthe hours of two and 4 AM, then you would use this schedule:\n\n    schedule { 'maint':\n      range  => '2 - 4',\n      period => daily,\n      repeat => 1,\n    }\n\nWith this schedule, the first time that Puppet runs between 2 and 4 AM,\nall resources with this schedule will get applied, but they won't\nget applied again between 2 and 4 because they will have already\nrun once that day, and they won't get applied outside that schedule\nbecause they will be outside the scheduled range.\n\nPuppet automatically creates a schedule for each of the valid periods\nwith the same name as that period (such as hourly and daily).\nAdditionally, a schedule named `puppet` is created and used as the\ndefault, with the following attributes:\n\n    schedule { 'puppet':\n      period => hourly,\n      repeat => 2,\n    }\n\nThis will cause resources to be applied every 30 minutes by default.\n\nThe `statettl` setting on the agent affects the ability of a schedule to\ndetermine if a resource has already been checked. If the `statettl` is\nset lower than the span of the associated schedule resource, then a\nresource could be checked & applied multiple times in the schedule as\nthe information about when the resource was last checked will have\nexpired from the cache."

When managing passwords\n  on these systems, the `salt` and `iterations` attributes need to be specified as\n  well as the password.\n* Windows passwords can be managed only in cleartext, because there is no Windows\n  API for setting the password hash.\n\n[stdlib]: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/\n\nEnclose any value that includes a dollar sign ($) in single quotes (') to avoid\naccidental variable interpolation.\n\nTo redact passwords from reports to PuppetDB, use the `Sensitive` data type. For\nexample, this resource protects the password:\n\n```puppet\nuser { 'foo':\n  ensure   => present,\n  password => Sensitive(\"my secret password\")\n}\n```\n\nThis results in the password being redacted from the report, as in the\n`previous_value`, `desired_value`, and `message` fields below.\n\n```yaml\n    events:\n    - !ruby/object:Puppet::Transaction::Event\n      audited: false\n      property: password\n      previous_value: \"[redacted]\"\n      desired_value: \"[redacted]\"\n      historical_value:\n      message: changed [redacted] to [redacted]\n      name: :password_changed\n      status: success\n      time: 2017-05-17 16:06:02.934398293 -07:00\n      redacted: true\n      corrective_change: false\n    corrective_change: false\n```"

An array, hash, string, or other iterable object that the function will iterate over.\n2. A lambda, which the function calls for each element in the first argument. It can request one (value) or two (index/key, value) parameters.\n\n`$data.index |$parameter| { <PUPPET CODE BLOCK> }`\n\nor\n\n`index($data) |$parameter| { <PUPPET CODE BLOCK> }`\n\n```puppet\n$data = [\"routers\", \"servers\", \"workstations\"]\nnotice $data.index |$value| { $value == 'servers' } # notices 1\nnotice $data.index |$value| { $value == 'hosts'  }  # notices undef\n```\n\n```puppet\n$data = {types => [\"routers\", \"servers\", \"workstations\"], colors => ['red', 'blue', 'green']}\nnotice $data.index |$value| { 'servers' in $value } # notices 'types'\nnotice $data.index |$value| { 'red' in $value }     # notices 'colors'\n```\nNote that the lambda gets the value and not an array with `[key, value]` as in other\niterative functions.\n\nUsing a lambda that accepts two values works the same way, it simply gets the index/key \nas the first parameter, and the value as the second.\n\n```puppet\n# Find the first even numbered index that has a non String value\n$data = [key1, 1, 3, 5]\nnotice $data.index |$idx, $value| { $idx % 2 == 0 and $value !~ String } # notices 2\n```\n\nWhen called on a `String`, the lambda is given each character as a value. What is typically wanted is to\nfind a sequence of characters which is achieved by calling the function with a value to search for instead\nof giving a lambda.\n\n\n```puppet\n# Find first occurrence of 'ah'\n$data = \"blablahbleh\"\nnotice $data.index('ah') # notices 5\n```\n\n```puppet\n# Find first occurrence of 'la' or 'le'\n$data = \"blablahbleh\"\nnotice $data.index(/l(a|e)/ # notices 1\n```\n\nWhen searching in a `String` with a given value that is neither `String` nor `Regexp` the answer is always `undef`.\nWhen searching in any other iterable, the value is matched against each value in the iteration using strict\nRuby `==` semantics. If Puppet Language semantics are wanted (where string compare is case insensitive) use a\nlambda and the `==` operator in Puppet.\n\n```puppet\n$data = ['routers', 'servers', 'WORKstations']\nnotice $data.index('servers')      # notices 1\nnotice $data.index('workstations') # notices undef (not matching case)\n```\n\nFor an general examples that demonstrates iteration, see the Puppet\n[iteration](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_iteration.html)\ndocumentation.",

By default,\nthis returns the first value found (and fails compilation if no values are\navailable), but you can configure it to merge multiple values into one, fail\ngracefully, and more.\n\nWhen looking up a key, Puppet will search up to three tiers of data, in the\nfollowing order:\n\n1. Hiera.\n2. The current environment's data provider.\n3. The indicated module's data provider, if the key is of the form\n   `<MODULE NAME>::<SOMETHING>`.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nYou must provide the name of a key to look up, and can optionally provide other\narguments. You can combine these arguments in the following ways:\n\n* `lookup( <NAME>, [<VALUE TYPE>], [<MERGE BEHAVIOR>], [<DEFAULT VALUE>] )`\n* `lookup( [<NAME>], <OPTIONS HASH> )`\n* `lookup( as above ) |$key| { # lambda returns a default value }`\n\nArguments in `[square brackets]` are optional.\n\nThe arguments accepted by `lookup` are as follows:\n\n1. `<NAME>` (string or array) --- The name of the key to look up.\n    * This can also be an array of keys. If Puppet doesn't find anything for the\n    first key, it will try again with the subsequent ones, only resorting to a\n    default value if none of them succeed.\n2. `<VALUE TYPE>` (data type) --- A\n[data type](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_data_type.html)\nthat must match the retrieved value; if not, the lookup (and catalog\ncompilation) will fail. Defaults to `Data` (accepts any normal value).\n3. `<MERGE BEHAVIOR>` (string or hash; see **\"Merge Behaviors\"** below) ---\nWhether (and how) to combine multiple values. If present, this overrides any\nmerge behavior specified in the data sources. Defaults to no value; Puppet will\nuse merge behavior from the data sources if present, and will otherwise do a\nfirst-found lookup.\n4. `<DEFAULT VALUE>` (any normal value) --- If present, `lookup` returns this\nwhen it can't find a normal value. Default values are never merged with found\nvalues. Like a normal value, the default must match the value type. Defaults to\nno value; if Puppet can't find a normal value, the lookup (and compilation) will\nfail.\n5. `<OPTIONS HASH>` (hash) --- Alternate way to set the arguments above, plus\nsome less-common extra options. If you pass an options hash, you can't combine\nit with any regular arguments (except `<NAME>`). An options hash can have the\nfollowing keys:\n    * `'name'` --- Same as `<NAME>` (argument 1). You can pass this as an\n    argument or in the hash, but not both.\n    * `'value_type'` --- Same as `<VALUE TYPE>` (argument 2).\n    * `'merge'` --- Same as `<MERGE BEHAVIOR>` (argument 3).\n    * `'default_value'` --- Same as `<DEFAULT VALUE>` (argument 4).\n    * `'default_values_hash'` (hash) --- A hash of lookup keys and default\n    values. If Puppet can't find a normal value, it will check this hash for the\n    requested key before giving up. You can combine this with `default_value` or\n    a lambda, which will be used if the key isn't present in this hash.

Puppet\n    will check for the requested key in the overrides hash _first;_ if found, it\n    returns that value as the _final_ value, ignoring merge behavior. Defaults\n    to an empty hash.\n\nFinally, `lookup` can take a lambda, which must accept a single parameter.\nThis is yet another way to set a default value for the lookup; if no results are\nfound, Puppet will pass the requested key to the lambda and use its result as\nthe default value.\n\n#### Merge Behaviors\n\nPuppet lookup uses a hierarchy of data sources, and a given key might have\nvalues in multiple sources. By default, Puppet returns the first value it finds,\nbut it can also continue searching and merge all the values together.\n\n> **Note:** Data sources can use the special `lookup_options` metadata key to\nrequest a specific merge behavior for a key. The `lookup` function will use that\nrequested behavior unless you explicitly specify one.\n\nThe valid merge behaviors are:\n\n* `'first'` --- Returns the first value found, with no merging. Puppet lookup's\ndefault behavior.\n* `'unique'` (called \"array merge\" in classic Hiera) --- Combines any number of\narrays and scalar values to return a merged, flattened array with all duplicate\nvalues removed. The lookup will fail if any hash values are found.\n* `'hash'` --- Combines the keys and values of any number of hashes to return a\nmerged hash. If the same key exists in multiple source hashes, Puppet will use\nthe value from the highest-priority data source; it won't recursively merge the\nvalues.\n* `'deep'` --- Combines the keys and values of any number of hashes to return a\nmerged hash. If the same key exists in multiple source hashes, Puppet will\nrecursively merge hash or array values (with duplicate values removed from\narrays). For conflicting scalar values, the highest-priority value will win.\n* `{'strategy' => 'first|unique|hash'}` --- Same as the string versions of these\nmerge behaviors.\n* `{'strategy' => 'deep', <DEEP OPTION> => <VALUE>, ...}` --- Same as `'deep'`,\nbut can adjust the merge with additional options. The available options are:\n    * `'knockout_prefix'` (string or undef) --- A string prefix to indicate a\n    value should be _removed_ from the final result. Defaults to `undef`, which\n    disables this feature.\n    * `'sort_merged_arrays'` (boolean) --- Whether to sort all arrays that are\n    merged together. Defaults to `false`.\n    * `'merge_hash_arrays'` (boolean) --- Whether to merge hashes within arrays.\n    Defaults to `false`.\n\n#### Examples\n\nLook up a key and return the first value found:\n\n    lookup('ntp::service_name')\n\nDo a unique merge lookup of class names, then add all of those classes to the\ncatalog (like `hiera_include`):\n\n    lookup('classes', Array[String], 'unique').include\n\nDo a deep hash merge lookup of user data, but let higher priority sources\nremove values by prefixing them with `--`:\n\n    lookup( { 'name'  => 'users',\n              'merge' => {\n                'strategy'        => 'deep',\n                'knockout_prefix' => '--',\n              },\n    })",

        "text": "Uses the Puppet lookup system to retrieve a value for a given key. By default,\nthis returns the first value found (and fails compilation if no values are\navailable), but you can configure it to merge multiple values into one, fail\ngracefully, and more.\n\nWhen looking up a key, Puppet will search up to three tiers of data, in the\nfollowing order:\n\n1. Hiera.\n2. The current environment's data provider.\n3. The indicated module's data provider, if the key is of the form\n   `<MODULE NAME>::<SOMETHING>`.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nYou must provide the name of a key to look up, and can optionally provide other\narguments. You can combine these arguments in the following ways:\n\n* `lookup( <NAME>, [<VALUE TYPE>], [<MERGE BEHAVIOR>], [<DEFAULT VALUE>] )`\n* `lookup( [<NAME>], <OPTIONS HASH> )`\n* `lookup( as above ) |$key| { # lambda returns a default value }`\n\nArguments in `[square brackets]` are optional.\n\nThe arguments accepted by `lookup` are as follows:\n\n1. `<NAME>` (string or array) --- The name of the key to look up.\n    * This can also be an array of keys. If Puppet doesn't find anything for the\n    first key, it will try again with the subsequent ones, only resorting to a\n    default value if none of them succeed.\n2. `<VALUE TYPE>` (data type) --- A\n[data type](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_data_type.html)\nthat must match the retrieved value; if not, the lookup (and catalog\ncompilation) will fail. Defaults to `Data` (accepts any normal value).\n3. `<MERGE BEHAVIOR>` (string or hash; see **\"Merge Behaviors\"** below) ---\nWhether (and how) to combine multiple values. If present, this overrides any\nmerge behavior specified in the data sources. Defaults to no value; Puppet will\nuse merge behavior from the data sources if present, and will otherwise do a\nfirst-found lookup.\n4. `<DEFAULT VALUE>` (any normal value) --- If present, `lookup` returns this\nwhen it can't find a normal value. Default values are never merged with found\nvalues. Like a normal value, the default must match the value type. Defaults to\nno value; if Puppet can't find a normal value, the lookup (and compilation) will\nfail.\n5. `<OPTIONS HASH>` (hash) --- Alternate way to set the arguments above, plus\nsome less-common extra options. If you pass an options hash, you can't combine\nit with any regular arguments (except `<NAME>`). An options hash can have the\nfollowing keys:\n    * `'name'` --- Same as `<NAME>` (argument 1). You can pass this as an\n    argument or in the hash, but not both.\n    * `'value_type'` --- Same as `<VALUE TYPE>` (argument 2).\n    * `'merge'` --- Same as `<MERGE BEHAVIOR>` (argument 3).\n    * `'default_value'` --- Same as `<DEFAULT VALUE>` (argument 4).\n    * `'default_values_hash'` (hash) --- A hash of lookup keys and default\n    values. If Puppet can't find a normal value, it will check this hash for the\n    requested key before giving up. You can combine this with `default_value` or\n    a lambda, which will be used if the key isn't present in this hash. Defaults\n    to an empty hash.\n    * `'override'` (hash) --- A hash of lookup keys and override values. Puppet\n    will check for the requested key in the overrides hash _first;_ if found, it\n    returns that value as the _final_ value, ignoring merge behavior. Defaults\n    to an empty hash.\n\nFinally, `lookup` can take a lambda, which must accept a single parameter.\nThis is yet another way to set a default value for the lookup; if no results are\nfound, Puppet will pass the requested key to the lambda and use its result as\nthe default value.\n\n#### Merge Behaviors\n\nPuppet lookup uses a hierarchy of data sources, and a given key might have\nvalues in multiple sources. By default, Puppet returns the first value it finds,\nbut it can also continue searching and merge all the values together.\n\n> **Note:** Data sources can use the special `lookup_options` metadata key to\nrequest a specific merge behavior for a key. The `lookup` function will use that\nrequested behavior unless you explicitly specify one.\n\nThe valid merge behaviors are:\n\n* `'first'` --- Returns the first value found, with no merging. Puppet lookup's\ndefault behavior.\n* `'unique'` (called \"array merge\" in classic Hiera) --- Combines any number of\narrays and scalar values to return a merged, flattened array with all duplicate\nvalues removed. The lookup will fail if any hash values are found.\n* `'hash'` --- Combines the keys and values of any number of hashes to return a\nmerged hash. If the same key exists in multiple source hashes, Puppet will use\nthe value from the highest-priority data source; it won't recursively merge the\nvalues.\n* `'deep'` --- Combines the keys and values of any number of hashes to return a\nmerged hash. If the same key exists in multiple source hashes, Puppet will\nrecursively merge hash or array values (with duplicate values removed from\narrays). For conflicting scalar values, the highest-priority value will win.\n* `{'strategy' => 'first'}`, `{'strategy' => 'unique'}`,\nor `{'strategy' => 'hash'}` --- Same as the string versions of these merge behaviors.\n* `{'strategy' => 'deep', <DEEP OPTION> => <VALUE>, ...}` --- Same as `'deep'`,\nbut can adjust the merge with additional options. The available options are:\n    * `'knockout_prefix'` (string or undef) --- A string prefix to indicate a\n    value should be _removed_ from the final result. If a value is exactly equal\n    to the prefix, it will knockout the entire element. Defaults to `undef`, which\n    disables this feature.\n    * `'sort_merged_arrays'` (boolean) --- Whether to sort all arrays that are\n    merged together. Defaults to `false`.\n    * `'merge_hash_arrays'` (boolean) --- Whether to merge hashes within arrays.\n    Defaults to `false`.",

In general, either convert values to be\nall `String` or all `Numeric` values before calling the function, or call the\nfunction with a lambda that performs type conversion and comparison. This because one\nsimply cannot compare `Boolean` with `Regexp` and with any arbitrary `Array`, `Hash` or\n`Object` and getting a meaningful result.\n\nThe one change in the function's behavior is when the function is given a single\narray argument. The stdlib implementation would return that array as the result where\nit now instead returns the max value from that array.\n\n```puppet\nnotice(max(1)) # would notice 1\nnotice(max(1,2)) # would notice 2\nnotice(max(\"1\", 2)) # would notice 2\nnotice(max(\"0777\", 512)) # would notice \"0777\", since \"0777\" is not converted from octal form\nnotice(max(0777, 512)) # would notice 512, since 0777 is decimal 511\nnotice(max('aa', 'ab')) # would notice 'ab'\nnotice(max(['a'], ['b'])) # would notice ['b'], since \"['b']\" is after \"['a']\"\n```\n\n```puppet\n$x = [1,2,3,4]\nnotice(max(*$x)) # would notice 4\n```\n\n```puppet\n$x = [1,2,3,4]\nnotice(max($x)) # would notice 4\nnotice($x.max) # would notice 4\n```\nThis example shows that a single array argument is used as the set of values\nas opposed to being a single returned value.\n\nWhen calling with a lambda, it must accept two variables and it must return\none of -1, 0, or 1 depending on if first argument is before/lower than, equal to,\nor higher/after the second argument.\n\n```puppet\nnotice(max(\"2\", \"10\", \"100\") |$a, $b| { compare($a, $b) })\n```\n\nWould notice \"2\" as higher since it is lexicographically higher/after the other values. Without the\nlambda the stdlib compatible (deprecated) behavior would have been to return \"100\" since number conversion\nkicks in.",

In general, either convert values to be\nall `String` or all `Numeric` values before calling the function, or call the\nfunction with a lambda that performs type conversion and comparison. This because one\nsimply cannot compare `Boolean` with `Regexp` and with any arbitrary `Array`, `Hash` or\n`Object` and getting a meaningful result.\n\nThe one change in the function's behavior is when the function is given a single\narray argument. The stdlib implementation would return that array as the result where\nit now instead returns the max value from that array.\n\n```puppet\nnotice(min(1)) # would notice 1\nnotice(min(1,2)) # would notice 1\nnotice(min(\"1\", 2)) # would notice 1\nnotice(min(\"0777\", 512)) # would notice 512, since \"0777\" is not converted from octal form\nnotice(min(0777, 512)) # would notice 511, since 0777 is decimal 511\nnotice(min('aa', 'ab')) # would notice 'aa'\nnotice(min(['a'], ['b'])) # would notice ['a'], since \"['a']\" is before \"['b']\"\n```\n\n```puppet\n$x = [1,2,3,4]\nnotice(min(*$x)) # would notice 1\n```\n\n```puppet\n$x = [1,2,3,4]\nnotice(min($x)) # would notice 1\nnotice($x.min) # would notice 1\n```\nThis example shows that a single array argument is used as the set of values\nas opposed to being a single returned value.\n\nWhen calling with a lambda, it must accept two variables and it must return\none of -1, 0, or 1 depending on if first argument is before/lower than, equal to,\nor higher/after the second argument.\n\n```puppet\nnotice(min(\"2\", \"10\", \"100\") |$a, $b| { compare($a, $b) })\n```\n\nWould notice \"10\" as lower since it is lexicographically lower/before the other values. Without the\nlambda the stdlib compatible (deprecated) behavior would have been to return \"2\" since number conversion kicks in.",

If a block is given it is called with the\njust created instance as an argument.\n\nCalling this function is equivalent to directly\ncalling the data type:\n\n**Example:** `new` and calling type directly are equivalent\n\n```puppet\n$a = Integer.new(\"42\")\n$b = Integer(\"42\")\n```\n\nThese would both convert the string `\"42\"` to the decimal value `42`.\n\n**Example:** arguments by position or by name\n\n```puppet\n$a = Integer.new(\"42\", 8)\n$b = Integer({from => \"42\", radix => 8})\n```\n\nThis would convert the octal (radix 8) number `\"42\"` in string form\nto the decimal value `34`.\n\nThe new function supports two ways of giving the arguments:\n\n* by name (using a hash with property to value mapping)\n* by position (as regular arguments)\n\nNote that it is not possible to create new instances of\nsome abstract data types (for example `Variant`). The data type `Optional[T]` is an\nexception as it will create an instance of `T` or `undef` if the\nvalue to convert is `undef`.\n\nThe arguments that can be given is determined by the data type.\n\n> An assertion is always made that the produced value complies with the given type constraints.\n\n**Example:** data type constraints are checked\n\n```puppet\nInteger[0].new(\"-100\")\n```\n\nWould fail with an assertion error (since value is less than 0).\n\nThe following sections show the arguments and conversion rules\nper data type built into the Puppet Type System.\n\n### Conversion to Optional[T] and NotUndef[T]\n\nConversion to these data types is the same as a conversion to the type argument `T`.\nIn the case of `Optional[T]` it is accepted that the argument to convert may be `undef`.\nIt is however not acceptable to give other arguments (than `undef`) that cannot be\nconverted to `T`.\n\n### Conversion to Integer\n\nA new `Integer` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.\nFor conversion from `String` it is possible to specify the radix (base).\n\n```puppet\ntype Radix = Variant[Default, Integer[2,2], Integer[8,8], Integer[10,10], Integer[16,16]]\n\nfunction Integer.new(\n  String $value,\n  Radix $radix = 10,\n  Boolean $abs = false\n)\n\nfunction Integer.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = false\n)\n```\n\n* When converting from `String` the default radix is 10.\n* If radix is not specified an attempt is made to detect the radix from the start of the string:\n  * `0b` or `0B` is taken as radix 2.\n  * `0x` or `0X` is taken as radix 16.\n  * `0` as radix 8.\n  * All others are decimal.\n* Conversion from `String` accepts an optional sign in the string.\n* For hexadecimal (radix 16) conversion an optional leading \"0x\", or \"0X\" is accepted.\n* For octal (radix 8) an optional leading \"0\" is accepted.\n* For binary (radix 2) an optional leading \"0b\" or \"0B\" is accepted.\n* When `radix` is set to `default`, the conversion is based on the leading.\n  characters in the string. A leading \"0\" for radix 8, a leading \"0x\", or \"0X\" for\n  radix 16, and leading \"0b\" or \"0B\" for binary.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* Conversion from `Integer`, `Float`, and `Boolean` ignores the radix.\n* `Float` value fractions are truncated (no rounding).\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute integer.\n\nExamples - Converting to Integer:\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Integer(\"0xFF\", 16)    # results in 255\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\")         # results in 8\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\", 10)     # results in 10\n$a_number = Integer(true)          # results in 1\n$a_number = Integer(-38, 10, true) # results in 38\n```\n\n### Conversion to Float\n\nA new `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.\nFor conversion from `String` both float and integer formats are supported.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Float.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* For an integer, the floating point fraction of `.0` is added to the value.\n* A `Boolean` `true` is converted to 1.0, and a `false` to 0.0\n* In `String` format, integer prefixes for hex and binary are understood (but not octal since\n  floating point in string format may start with a '0').\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute floating point value.\n\n### Conversion to Numeric\n\nA new `Integer` or `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean` and\n`String` values.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Numeric.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* If the value has a decimal period, or if given in scientific notation\n  (e/E), the result is a `Float`, otherwise the value is an `Integer`. The\n  conversion from `String` always uses a radix based on the prefix of the string.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute `Float`or `Integer` value.\n\nExamples - Converting to Numeric\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Numeric(true)        # results in 1\n$a_number = Numeric(\"0xFF\")      # results in 255\n$a_number = Numeric(\"010\")       # results in 8\n$a_number = Numeric(\"3.14\")      # results in 3.14 (a float)\n$a_number = Numeric(-42.3, true) # results in 42.3\n$a_number = Numeric(-42, true)   # results in 42\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timespan\n\nA new `Timespan` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n#### Timespan from seconds\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n#### Timespan from days, hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second\n\nThe arguments can be passed separately in which case the first four, days, hours, minutes, and seconds are mandatory and the rest are optional.\nAll values may overflow and/or be negative. The internal 128-bit nano-second integer is calculated as:\n\n```\n(((((days * 24 + hours) * 60 + minutes) * 60 + seconds) * 1000 + milliseconds) * 1000 + microseconds) * 1000 + nanoseconds\n```\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Integer $days, Integer $hours, Integer $minutes, Integer $seconds,\n  Integer $milliseconds = 0, Integer $microseconds = 0, Integer $nanoseconds = 0\n)\n```\n\nor, all arguments can be passed as a `Hash`, in which case all entries are optional:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    Optional[negative] => Boolean,\n    Optional[days] => Integer,\n    Optional[hours] => Integer,\n    Optional[minutes] => Integer,\n    Optional[seconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[milliseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[microseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[nanoseconds] => Integer\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\n#### Timespan from String and format directive patterns\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  String $string, Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n\n##### Format directives:\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| D | Number of Days |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..59) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999) |\n| N | Fractional seconds digits |\n\nThe format directive that represents the highest magnitude in the format will be allowed to\noverflow. I.e. if no \"%D\" is used but a \"%H\" is present, then the hours may be more than 23.\n\nThe default array contains the following patterns:\n\n```\n['%D-%H:%M:%S', '%D-%H:%M', '%H:%M:%S', '%H:%M']\n```\n\nExamples - Converting to Timespan\n\n```puppet\n$duration = Timespan(13.5)       # 13 seconds and 500 milliseconds\n$duration = Timespan({days=>4})  # 4 days\n$duration = Timespan(4, 0, 0, 2) # 4 days and 2 seconds\n$duration = Timespan('13:20')    # 13 hours and 20 minutes (using default pattern)\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%L') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 milli-seconds\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%N') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 nano-seconds\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timestamp\n\nA new `Timestamp` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n#### Timestamp from seconds since epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n#### Timestamp from String and patterns consisting of format directives\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nA third optional timezone argument can be provided. The first argument will then be parsed as if it represents a local time in that\ntimezone. The timezone can be any timezone that is recognized when using the '%z' or '%Z' formats, or the word 'current', in which\ncase the current timezone of the evaluating process will be used. The timezone argument is case insensitive.\n\nThe default timezone, when no argument is provided, or when using the keyword `default`, is 'UTC'.\n\nIt is illegal to provide a timezone argument other than `default` in combination with a format that contains '%z' or '%Z' since that\nwould introduce an ambiguity as to which timezone to use. The one extracted from the string, or the one provided as an argument.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  String $string,\n  Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>,\n  String $timezone = default)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]],\n    Optional[timezone] => String[1]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n| #     | Change names to upper-case or change case of am/pm\n| ^     | Use uppercase\n| :     | Use colons for %z\n\n##### Format directives (names and padding can be altered using flags):\n\n**Date (Year, Month, Day):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| Y | Year with century, zero-padded to at least 4 digits |\n| C | year / 100 (rounded down such as 20 in 2009) |\n| y | year % 100 (00..99) |\n| m | Month of the year, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| B | The full month name (\"January\") |\n| b | The abbreviated month name (\"Jan\") |\n| h | Equivalent to %b |\n| d | Day of the month, zero-padded (01..31) |\n| e | Day of the month, blank-padded ( 1..31) |\n| j | Day of the year (001..366) |\n\n**Time (Hour, Minute, Second, Subsecond):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, zero-padded (00..23) |\n| k | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, blank-padded ( 0..23) |\n| I | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| l | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, blank-padded ( 1..12) |\n| P | Meridian indicator, lowercase (\"am\" or \"pm\") |\n| p | Meridian indicator, uppercase (\"AM\" or \"PM\") |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..60) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999).

The defaults for the many options\nhave been chosen with care to be the most basic \"value in textual form\" representation.\nThe more advanced forms of formatting are intended to enable writing special purposes formatting\nfunctions in the Puppet language.\n\nA new string can be created from all other data types. The process is performed in\nseveral steps - first the data type of the given value is inferred, then the resulting data type\nis used to find the most significant format specified for that data type. And finally,\nthe found format is used to convert the given value.\n\nThe mapping from data type to format is referred to as the *format map*. This map\nallows different formatting depending on type.\n\n**Example:** Positive Integers in Hexadecimal prefixed with '0x', negative in Decimal\n\n```puppet\n$format_map = {\n  Integer[default, 0] => \"%d\",\n  Integer[1, default] => \"%#x\"\n}\nString(\"-1\", $format_map)  # produces '-1'\nString(\"10\", $format_map)  # produces '0xa'\n```\n\nA format is specified on the form:\n\n```\n%[Flags][Width][.Precision]Format\n```\n\n`Width` is the number of characters into which the value should be fitted. This allocated space is\npadded if value is shorter. By default it is space padded, and the flag `0` will cause padding with `0`\nfor numerical formats.\n\n`Precision` is the number of fractional digits to show for floating point, and the maximum characters\nincluded in a string format.\n\nNote that all data type supports the formats `s` and `p` with the meaning \"default string representation\" and\n\"default programmatic string representation\" (which for example means that a String is quoted in 'p' format).\n\n#### Signatures of String conversion\n\n```puppet\ntype Format = Pattern[/^%([\\s\\+\\-#0\\[\\{<\\(\\|]*)([1-9][0-9]*)?(?:\\.([0-9]+))?([a-zA-Z])/]\ntype ContainerFormat = Struct[{\n  format         => Optional[String],\n  separator      => Optional[String],\n  separator2     => Optional[String],\n  string_formats => Hash[Type, Format]\n  }]\ntype TypeMap = Hash[Type, Variant[Format, ContainerFormat]]\ntype Formats = Variant[Default, String[1], TypeMap]\n\nfunction String.new(\n  Any $value,\n  Formats $string_formats\n)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `separator` is the string used to separate entries in an array, or hash (extra space should not be included at\n  the end), defaults to `\",\"`\n* `separator2` is the separator between key and value in a hash entry (space padding should be included as\n  wanted), defaults to `\" => \"`.\n* `string_formats` is a data type to format map for values contained in arrays and hashes - defaults to `{Any => \"%p\"}`. Note that\n  these nested formats are not applicable to data types that are containers; they are always formatted as per the top level\n  format specification.\n\n**Example:** Simple Conversion to String (using defaults)\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10)      # produces '10'\n$str = String([10])    # produces '[\"10\"]'\n```\n\n**Example:** Simple Conversion to String specifying the format for the given value directly\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10, \"%#x\")    # produces '0x10'\n$str = String([10], \"%(a\")  # produces '(\"10\")'\n```\n\n**Example:** Specifying type for values contained in an array\n\n```puppet\n$formats = {\n  Array => {\n    format => '%(a',\n    string_formats => { Integer => '%#x' }\n  }\n}\n$str = String([1,2,3], $formats) # produces '(0x1, 0x2, 0x3)'\n```\n\nThe given formats are merged with the default formats, and matching of values to convert against format is based on\nthe specificity of the mapped type; for example, different formats can be used for short and long arrays.\n\n#### Integer to String\n\n| Format  | Integer Formats\n| ------  | ---------------\n| d       | Decimal, negative values produces leading '-'.\n| x X     | Hexadecimal in lower or upper case. Uses ..f/..F for negative values unless + is also used. A `#` adds prefix 0x/0X.\n| o       | Octal. Uses ..0 for negative values unless `+` is also used.

an array of tuples on the form `[path, value]`\n(where the `path` is the path from the root of a tree, and `value` the value at that position in the tree), and\neither the option `'tree'` (do not convert arrays to hashes except the top level), or\n`'hash_tree'` (convert all arrays to hashes).\n\nThe tree/hash_tree forms of Hash creation are suited for transforming the result of an iteration\nusing `tree_each` and subsequent filtering or mapping.\n\n**Example:** Mapping a hash tree\n\nMapping an arbitrary structure in a way that keeps the structure, but where some values are replaced\ncan be done by using the `tree_each` function, mapping, and then constructing a new Hash from the result:\n\n```puppet\n# A hash tree with 'water' at different locations\n$h = { a => { b => { x => 'water'}}, b => { y => 'water'} }\n# a helper function that turns water into wine\nfunction make_wine($x) { if $x == 'water' { 'wine' } else { $x } }\n# create a flattened tree with water turned into wine\n$flat_tree = $h.tree_each.map |$entry| { [$entry[0], make_wine($entry[1])] }\n# create a new Hash and log it\nnotice Hash($flat_tree, 'hash_tree')\n```\n\nWould notice the hash `{a => {b => {x => wine}}, b => {y => wine}}`\n\nConversion to a `Struct` works exactly as conversion to a `Hash`, only that the constructed hash is\nasserted against the given struct type.\n\n### Conversion to a Regexp\n\nA `String` can be converted into a `Regexp`\n\n**Example**: Converting a String into a Regexp\n```puppet\n$s = '[a-z]+\\.com'\n$r = Regexp($s)\nif('foo.com' =~ $r) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVer\n\nA SemVer object represents a single [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/).\nIt can be created from a String, individual values for its parts, or a hash specifying the value per part.\nSee the specification at [semver.org](http://semver.org/) for the meaning of the SemVer's parts.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype PositiveInteger = Integer[0,default]\ntype SemVerQualifier = Pattern[/\\A(?<part>[0-9A-Za-z-]+)(?:\\.\\g<part>)*\\Z/]\ntype SemVerString = String[1]\ntype SemVerHash =Struct[{\n  major                => PositiveInteger,\n  minor                => PositiveInteger,\n  patch                => PositiveInteger,\n  Optional[prerelease] => SemVerQualifier,\n  Optional[build]      => SemVerQualifier\n}]\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerString $str)\n\nfunction SemVer.new(\n        PositiveInteger           $major\n        PositiveInteger           $minor\n        PositiveInteger           $patch\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $prerelease = undef\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $build = undef\n        )\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerHash $hash_args)\n```\n\n**Examples:** SemVer and SemVerRange usage\n\n```puppet\n# As a type, SemVer can describe disjunct ranges which versions can be\n# matched against - here the type is constructed with two\n# SemVerRange objects.\n#\n$t = SemVer[\n  SemVerRange('>=1.0.0 <2.0.0'),\n  SemVerRange('>=3.0.0 <4.0.0')\n]\nnotice(SemVer('1.2.3') =~ $t) # true\nnotice(SemVer('2.3.4') =~ $t) # false\nnotice(SemVer('3.4.5') =~ $t) # true\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVerRange\n\nA `SemVerRange` object represents a range of `SemVer`. It can be created from\na `String`, or from two `SemVer` instances, where either end can be given as\na literal `default` to indicate infinity. The string format of a `SemVerRange` is specified by\nthe [Semantic Version Range Grammar](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges).\n\n> Use of the comparator sets described in the grammar (joining with `||`) is not supported.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype SemVerRangeString = String[1]\ntype SemVerRangeHash = Struct[{\n  min                   => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[max]         => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[exclude_max] => Boolean\n}]\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeString $semver_range_string\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $min\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $max\n  Optional[Boolean]       $exclude_max = undef\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeHash $semver_range_hash\n)\n```\n\nFor examples of `SemVerRange` use, see \"Creating a SemVer\".\n\n### Creating a Binary\n\nA `Binary` object represents a sequence of bytes and it can be created from a String in Base64 format,\nan Array containing byte values. A Binary can also be created from a Hash containing the value to convert to\na `Binary`.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype ByteInteger = Integer[0,255]\ntype Base64Format = Enum[\"%b\", \"%u\", \"%B\", \"%s\"]\ntype StringHash = Struct[{value => String, \"format\" => Optional[Base64Format]}]\ntype ArrayHash = Struct[{value => Array[ByteInteger]}]\ntype BinaryArgsHash = Variant[StringHash, ArrayHash]\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  String $base64_str,\n  Optional[Base64Format] $format\n)\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  Array[ByteInteger] $byte_array\n}\n\n# Same as for String, or for Array, but where arguments are given in a Hash.\nfunction Binary.new(BinaryArgsHash $hash_args)\n```\n\nThe formats have the following meaning:\n\n| format | explanation |\n| ----   | ----        |\n| B | The data is in base64 strict encoding\n| u | The data is in URL safe base64 encoding\n| b | The data is in base64 encoding, padding as required by base64 strict, is added by default\n| s | The data is a puppet string. The string must be valid UTF-8, or convertible to UTF-8 or an error is raised.\n| r | (Ruby Raw) the byte sequence in the given string is used verbatim irrespective of possible encoding errors\n\n* The default format is `%B`.\n* Note that the format `%r` should be used sparingly, or not at all. It exists for backwards compatibility reasons when someone receiving\n  a string from some function and that string should be treated as Binary. Such code should be changed to return a Binary instead of a String.\n\n**Examples:** Creating a Binary\n\n```puppet\n# create the binary content \"abc\"\n$a = Binary('YWJj')\n\n# create the binary content from content in a module's file\n$b = binary_file('mymodule/mypicture.jpg')\n```\n\n* Since 4.5.0\n* Binary type since 4.8.0\n\nCreating an instance of a `Type` using the `Init` type.\n-------\n\nThe type `Init[T]` describes a value that can be used when instantiating a type. When used as the first argument in a call to `new`, it\nwill dispatch the call to its contained type and optionally augment the parameter list with additional arguments.\n\n**Example:** Creating an instance of Integer using Init[Integer]\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer].new('128')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer.new('128')\n```\n\nor, with base 16 and using implicit new\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer,16]('80')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer('80', 16)\n```\n\n**Example:** Creating an instance of String using a predefined format\n\n```puppet\n$fmt = Init[String,'%#x']\nnotice($fmt(256)) # will notice '0x100'\n```",

If a block is given it is called with the\njust created instance as an argument.\n\nCalling this function is equivalent to directly\ncalling the data type:\n\n**Example:** `new` and calling type directly are equivalent\n\n```puppet\n$a = Integer.new(\"42\")\n$b = Integer(\"42\")\n```\n\nThese would both convert the string `\"42\"` to the decimal value `42`.\n\n**Example:** arguments by position or by name\n\n```puppet\n$a = Integer.new(\"42\", 8)\n$b = Integer({from => \"42\", radix => 8})\n```\n\nThis would convert the octal (radix 8) number `\"42\"` in string form\nto the decimal value `34`.\n\nThe new function supports two ways of giving the arguments:\n\n* by name (using a hash with property to value mapping)\n* by position (as regular arguments)\n\nNote that it is not possible to create new instances of\nsome abstract data types (for example `Variant`). The data type `Optional[T]` is an\nexception as it will create an instance of `T` or `undef` if the\nvalue to convert is `undef`.\n\nThe arguments that can be given is determined by the data type.\n\n> An assertion is always made that the produced value complies with the given type constraints.\n\n**Example:** data type constraints are checked\n\n```puppet\nInteger[0].new(\"-100\")\n```\n\nWould fail with an assertion error (since value is less than 0).\n\nThe following sections show the arguments and conversion rules\nper data type built into the Puppet Type System.\n\n### Conversion to Optional[T] and NotUndef[T]\n\nConversion to these data types is the same as a conversion to the type argument `T`.\nIn the case of `Optional[T]` it is accepted that the argument to convert may be `undef`.\nIt is however not acceptable to give other arguments (than `undef`) that cannot be\nconverted to `T`.\n\n### Conversion to Integer\n\nA new `Integer` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.\nFor conversion from `String` it is possible to specify the radix (base).\n\n```puppet\ntype Radix = Variant[Default, Integer[2,2], Integer[8,8], Integer[10,10], Integer[16,16]]\n\nfunction Integer.new(\n  String $value,\n  Radix $radix = 10,\n  Boolean $abs = false\n)\n\nfunction Integer.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = false\n)\n```\n\n* When converting from `String` the default radix is 10.\n* If radix is not specified an attempt is made to detect the radix from the start of the string:\n  * `0b` or `0B` is taken as radix 2.\n  * `0x` or `0X` is taken as radix 16.\n  * `0` as radix 8.\n  * All others are decimal.\n* Conversion from `String` accepts an optional sign in the string.\n* For hexadecimal (radix 16) conversion an optional leading \"0x\", or \"0X\" is accepted.\n* For octal (radix 8) an optional leading \"0\" is accepted.\n* For binary (radix 2) an optional leading \"0b\" or \"0B\" is accepted.\n* When `radix` is set to `default`, the conversion is based on the leading.\n  characters in the string. A leading \"0\" for radix 8, a leading \"0x\", or \"0X\" for\n  radix 16, and leading \"0b\" or \"0B\" for binary.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* Conversion from `Integer`, `Float`, and `Boolean` ignores the radix.\n* `Float` value fractions are truncated (no rounding).\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute integer.\n\nExamples - Converting to Integer:\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Integer(\"0xFF\", 16)    # results in 255\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\")         # results in 8\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\", 10)     # results in 10\n$a_number = Integer(true)          # results in 1\n$a_number = Integer(-38, 10, true) # results in 38\n```\n\n### Conversion to Float\n\nA new `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.\nFor conversion from `String` both float and integer formats are supported.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Float.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* For an integer, the floating point fraction of `.0` is added to the value.\n* A `Boolean` `true` is converted to 1.0, and a `false` to 0.0\n* In `String` format, integer prefixes for hex and binary are understood (but not octal since\n  floating point in string format may start with a '0').\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute floating point value.\n\n### Conversion to Numeric\n\nA new `Integer` or `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean` and\n`String` values.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Numeric.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* If the value has a decimal period, or if given in scientific notation\n  (e/E), the result is a `Float`, otherwise the value is an `Integer`. The\n  conversion from `String` always uses a radix based on the prefix of the string.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute `Float`or `Integer` value.\n\nExamples - Converting to Numeric\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Numeric(true)        # results in 1\n$a_number = Numeric(\"0xFF\")      # results in 255\n$a_number = Numeric(\"010\")       # results in 8\n$a_number = Numeric(\"3.14\")      # results in 3.14 (a float)\n$a_number = Numeric(-42.3, true) # results in 42.3\n$a_number = Numeric(-42, true)   # results in 42\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timespan\n\nA new `Timespan` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n#### Timespan from seconds\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n#### Timespan from days, hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second\n\nThe arguments can be passed separately in which case the first four, days, hours, minutes, and seconds are mandatory and the rest are optional.\nAll values may overflow and/or be negative. The internal 128-bit nano-second integer is calculated as:\n\n```\n(((((days * 24 + hours) * 60 + minutes) * 60 + seconds) * 1000 + milliseconds) * 1000 + microseconds) * 1000 + nanoseconds\n```\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Integer $days, Integer $hours, Integer $minutes, Integer $seconds,\n  Integer $milliseconds = 0, Integer $microseconds = 0, Integer $nanoseconds = 0\n)\n```\n\nor, all arguments can be passed as a `Hash`, in which case all entries are optional:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    Optional[negative] => Boolean,\n    Optional[days] => Integer,\n    Optional[hours] => Integer,\n    Optional[minutes] => Integer,\n    Optional[seconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[milliseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[microseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[nanoseconds] => Integer\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\n#### Timespan from String and format directive patterns\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  String $string, Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n\n##### Format directives:\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| D | Number of Days |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..59) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999) |\n| N | Fractional seconds digits |\n\nThe format directive that represents the highest magnitude in the format will be allowed to\noverflow. I.e. if no \"%D\" is used but a \"%H\" is present, then the hours may be more than 23.\n\nThe default array contains the following patterns:\n\n```\n['%D-%H:%M:%S', '%D-%H:%M', '%H:%M:%S', '%H:%M']\n```\n\nExamples - Converting to Timespan\n\n```puppet\n$duration = Timespan(13.5)       # 13 seconds and 500 milliseconds\n$duration = Timespan({days=>4})  # 4 days\n$duration = Timespan(4, 0, 0, 2) # 4 days and 2 seconds\n$duration = Timespan('13:20')    # 13 hours and 20 minutes (using default pattern)\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%L') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 milli-seconds\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%N') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 nano-seconds\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timestamp\n\nA new `Timestamp` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values.

When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nA third optional timezone argument can be provided. The first argument will then be parsed as if it represents a local time in that\ntimezone. The timezone can be any timezone that is recognized when using the '%z' or '%Z' formats, or the word 'current', in which\ncase the current timezone of the evaluating process will be used. The timezone argument is case insensitive.\n\nThe default timezone, when no argument is provided, or when using the keyword `default`, is 'UTC'.\n\nIt is illegal to provide a timezone argument other than `default` in combination with a format that contains '%z' or '%Z' since that\nwould introduce an ambiguity as to which timezone to use. The one extracted from the string, or the one provided as an argument.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  String $string,\n  Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>,\n  String $timezone = default)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]],\n    Optional[timezone] => String[1]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n| #     | Change names to upper-case or change case of am/pm\n| ^     | Use uppercase\n| :     | Use colons for %z\n\n##### Format directives (names and padding can be altered using flags):\n\n**Date (Year, Month, Day):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| Y | Year with century, zero-padded to at least 4 digits |\n| C | year / 100 (rounded down such as 20 in 2009) |\n| y | year % 100 (00..99) |\n| m | Month of the year, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| B | The full month name (\"January\") |\n| b | The abbreviated month name (\"Jan\") |\n| h | Equivalent to %b |\n| d | Day of the month, zero-padded (01..31) |\n| e | Day of the month, blank-padded ( 1..31) |\n| j | Day of the year (001..366) |\n\n**Time (Hour, Minute, Second, Subsecond):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, zero-padded (00..23) |\n| k | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, blank-padded ( 0..23) |\n| I | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| l | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, blank-padded ( 1..12) |\n| P | Meridian indicator, lowercase (\"am\" or \"pm\") |\n| p | Meridian indicator, uppercase (\"AM\" or \"PM\") |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..60) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999).

The defaults for the many options\nhave been chosen with care to be the most basic \"value in textual form\" representation.\nThe more advanced forms of formatting are intended to enable writing special purposes formatting\nfunctions in the Puppet language.\n\nA new string can be created from all other data types. The process is performed in\nseveral steps - first the data type of the given value is inferred, then the resulting data type\nis used to find the most significant format specified for that data type. And finally,\nthe found format is used to convert the given value.\n\nThe mapping from data type to format is referred to as the *format map*. This map\nallows different formatting depending on type.\n\n**Example:** Positive Integers in Hexadecimal prefixed with '0x', negative in Decimal\n\n```puppet\n$format_map = {\n  Integer[default, 0] => \"%d\",\n  Integer[1, default] => \"%#x\"\n}\nString(\"-1\", $format_map)  # produces '-1'\nString(\"10\", $format_map)  # produces '0xa'\n```\n\nA format is specified on the form:\n\n```\n%[Flags][Width][.Precision]Format\n```\n\n`Width` is the number of characters into which the value should be fitted. This allocated space is\npadded if value is shorter. By default it is space padded, and the flag `0` will cause padding with `0`\nfor numerical formats.\n\n`Precision` is the number of fractional digits to show for floating point, and the maximum characters\nincluded in a string format.\n\nNote that all data type supports the formats `s` and `p` with the meaning \"default string representation\" and\n\"default programmatic string representation\" (which for example means that a String is quoted in 'p' format).\n\n#### Signatures of String conversion\n\n```puppet\ntype Format = Pattern[/^%([\\s\\+\\-#0\\[\\{<\\(\\|]*)([1-9][0-9]*)?(?:\\.([0-9]+))?([a-zA-Z])/]\ntype ContainerFormat = Struct[{\n  format         => Optional[String],\n  separator      => Optional[String],\n  separator2     => Optional[String],\n  string_formats => Hash[Type, Format]\n  }]\ntype TypeMap = Hash[Type, Variant[Format, ContainerFormat]]\ntype Formats = Variant[Default, String[1], TypeMap]\n\nfunction String.new(\n  Any $value,\n  Formats $string_formats\n)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `separator` is the string used to separate entries in an array, or hash (extra space should not be included at\n  the end), defaults to `\",\"`\n* `separator2` is the separator between key and value in a hash entry (space padding should be included as\n  wanted), defaults to `\" => \"`.\n* `string_formats` is a data type to format map for values contained in arrays and hashes - defaults to `{Any => \"%p\"}`. Note that\n  these nested formats are not applicable to data types that are containers; they are always formatted as per the top level\n  format specification.\n\n**Example:** Simple Conversion to String (using defaults)\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10)      # produces '10'\n$str = String([10])    # produces '[\"10\"]'\n```\n\n**Example:** Simple Conversion to String specifying the format for the given value directly\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10, \"%#x\")    # produces '0x10'\n$str = String([10], \"%(a\")  # produces '(\"10\")'\n```\n\n**Example:** Specifying type for values contained in an array\n\n```puppet\n$formats = {\n  Array => {\n    format => '%(a',\n    string_formats => { Integer => '%#x' }\n  }\n}\n$str = String([1,2,3], $formats) # produces '(0x1, 0x2, 0x3)'\n```\n\nThe given formats are merged with the default formats, and matching of values to convert against format is based on\nthe specificity of the mapped type; for example, different formats can be used for short and long arrays.\n\n#### Integer to String\n\n| Format  | Integer Formats\n| ------  | ---------------\n| d       | Decimal, negative values produces leading '-'.\n| x X     | Hexadecimal in lower or upper case. Uses ..f/..F for negative values unless + is also used. A `#` adds prefix 0x/0X.\n| o       | Octal. Uses ..0 for negative values unless `+` is also used. A `#` adds prefix 0.\n| b B     | Binary with prefix 'b' or 'B'.

If width is also set\nit is taken as the maximum allowed length of a sequence of elements (not including delimiters). If this max length\nis exceeded, each element will be indented.\n\n#### Hash & Struct to String\n\n| Format    | Hash/Struct Formats\n| ------    | -------------\n| h         | Formats with `{ }` delimiters, `,` element separator and ` => ` inner element separator unless overridden by flags.\n| s         | Same as h.\n| p         | Same as h.\n| a         | Converts the hash to an array of [k,v] tuples and formats it using array rule(s).\n\nSee \"Flags\" `<[({\\|` for formatting of delimiters, and \"Additional parameters for containers; Array and Hash\" for\nmore information about options.\n\nThe alternate form flag `#` will format each hash key/value entry indented on a separate line.\n\n#### Type to String\n\n| Format    | Array/Tuple Formats\n| ------    | -------------\n| s         | The same as `p`, quoted if alternative flag `#` is used.\n| p         | Outputs the type in string form as specified by the Puppet Language.\n\n#### Flags\n\n| Flag     | Effect\n| ------   | ------\n| (space)  | A space instead of `+` for numeric output (`-` is shown), for containers skips delimiters.\n| #        | Alternate format; prefix 0x/0x, 0 (octal) and 0b/0B for binary, Floats force decimal '.'.

an array of tuples on the form `[path, value]`\n(where the `path` is the path from the root of a tree, and `value` the value at that position in the tree), and\neither the option `'tree'` (do not convert arrays to hashes except the top level), or\n`'hash_tree'` (convert all arrays to hashes).\n\nThe tree/hash_tree forms of Hash creation are suited for transforming the result of an iteration\nusing `tree_each` and subsequent filtering or mapping.\n\n**Example:** Mapping a hash tree\n\nMapping an arbitrary structure in a way that keeps the structure, but where some values are replaced\ncan be done by using the `tree_each` function, mapping, and then constructing a new Hash from the result:\n\n```puppet\n# A hash tree with 'water' at different locations\n$h = { a => { b => { x => 'water'}}, b => { y => 'water'} }\n# a helper function that turns water into wine\nfunction make_wine($x) { if $x == 'water' { 'wine' } else { $x } }\n# create a flattened tree with water turned into wine\n$flat_tree = $h.tree_each.map |$entry| { [$entry[0], make_wine($entry[1])] }\n# create a new Hash and log it\nnotice Hash($flat_tree, 'hash_tree')\n```\n\nWould notice the hash `{a => {b => {x => wine}}, b => {y => wine}}`\n\nConversion to a `Struct` works exactly as conversion to a `Hash`, only that the constructed hash is\nasserted against the given struct type.\n\n### Conversion to a Regexp\n\nA `String` can be converted into a `Regexp`\n\n**Example**: Converting a String into a Regexp\n```puppet\n$s = '[a-z]+\\.com'\n$r = Regexp($s)\nif('foo.com' =~ $r) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVer\n\nA SemVer object represents a single [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/).\nIt can be created from a String, individual values for its parts, or a hash specifying the value per part.\nSee the specification at [semver.org](http://semver.org/) for the meaning of the SemVer's parts.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype PositiveInteger = Integer[0,default]\ntype SemVerQualifier = Pattern[/\\A(?<part>[0-9A-Za-z-]+)(?:\\.\\g<part>)*\\Z/]\ntype SemVerString = String[1]\ntype SemVerHash =Struct[{\n  major                => PositiveInteger,\n  minor                => PositiveInteger,\n  patch                => PositiveInteger,\n  Optional[prerelease] => SemVerQualifier,\n  Optional[build]      => SemVerQualifier\n}]\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerString $str)\n\nfunction SemVer.new(\n        PositiveInteger           $major\n        PositiveInteger           $minor\n        PositiveInteger           $patch\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $prerelease = undef\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $build = undef\n        )\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerHash $hash_args)\n```\n\n**Examples:** SemVer and SemVerRange usage\n\n```puppet\n# As a type, SemVer can describe disjunct ranges which versions can be\n# matched against - here the type is constructed with two\n# SemVerRange objects.\n#\n$t = SemVer[\n  SemVerRange('>=1.0.0 <2.0.0'),\n  SemVerRange('>=3.0.0 <4.0.0')\n]\nnotice(SemVer('1.2.3') =~ $t) # true\nnotice(SemVer('2.3.4') =~ $t) # false\nnotice(SemVer('3.4.5') =~ $t) # true\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVerRange\n\nA `SemVerRange` object represents a range of `SemVer`. It can be created from\na `String`, or from two `SemVer` instances, where either end can be given as\na literal `default` to indicate infinity. The string format of a `SemVerRange` is specified by\nthe [Semantic Version Range Grammar](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges).\n\n> Use of the comparator sets described in the grammar (joining with `||`) is not supported.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype SemVerRangeString = String[1]\ntype SemVerRangeHash = Struct[{\n  min                   => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[max]         => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[exclude_max] => Boolean\n}]\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeString $semver_range_string\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $min\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $max\n  Optional[Boolean]       $exclude_max = undef\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeHash $semver_range_hash\n)\n```\n\nFor examples of `SemVerRange` use, see \"Creating a SemVer\".\n\n### Creating a Binary\n\nA `Binary` object represents a sequence of bytes and it can be created from a String in Base64 format,\nan Array containing byte values. A Binary can also be created from a Hash containing the value to convert to\na `Binary`.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype ByteInteger = Integer[0,255]\ntype Base64Format = Enum[\"%b\", \"%u\", \"%B\", \"%s\"]\ntype StringHash = Struct[{value => String, \"format\" => Optional[Base64Format]}]\ntype ArrayHash = Struct[{value => Array[ByteInteger]}]\ntype BinaryArgsHash = Variant[StringHash, ArrayHash]\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  String $base64_str,\n  Optional[Base64Format] $format\n)\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  Array[ByteInteger] $byte_array\n}\n\n# Same as for String, or for Array, but where arguments are given in a Hash.\nfunction Binary.new(BinaryArgsHash $hash_args)\n```\n\nThe formats have the following meaning:\n\n| format | explanation |\n| ----   | ----        |\n| B | The data is in base64 strict encoding\n| u | The data is in URL safe base64 encoding\n| b | The data is in base64 encoding, padding as required by base64 strict, is added by default\n| s | The data is a puppet string. The string must be valid UTF-8, or convertible to UTF-8 or an error is raised.\n| r | (Ruby Raw) the byte sequence in the given string is used verbatim irrespective of possible encoding errors\n\n* The default format is `%B`.\n* Note that the format `%r` should be used sparingly, or not at all. It exists for backwards compatibility reasons when someone receiving\n  a string from some function and that string should be treated as Binary. Such code should be changed to return a Binary instead of a String.\n\n**Examples:** Creating a Binary\n\n```puppet\n# create the binary content \"abc\"\n$a = Binary('YWJj')\n\n# create the binary content from content in a module's file\n$b = binary_file('mymodule/mypicture.jpg')\n```\n\n* Since 4.5.0\n* Binary type since 4.8.0\n\nCreating an instance of a `Type` using the `Init` type.\n-------\n\nThe type `Init[T]` describes a value that can be used when instantiating a type. When used as the first argument in a call to `new`, it\nwill dispatch the call to its contained type and optionally augment the parameter list with additional arguments.\n\n**Example:** Creating an instance of Integer using Init[Integer]\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer].new('128')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer.new('128')\n```\n\nor, with base 16 and using implicit new\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer,16]('80')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer('80', 16)\n```\n\n**Example:** Creating an instance of String using a predefined format\n\n```puppet\n$fmt = Init[String,'%#x']\nnotice($fmt(256)) # will notice '0x100'\n```",

If a block is given it is called with the\njust created instance as an argument.\n\nCalling this function is equivalent to directly\ncalling the data type:\n\n**Example:** `new` and calling type directly are equivalent\n\n```puppet\n$a = Integer.new(\"42\")\n$b = Integer(\"42\")\n```\n\nThese would both convert the string `\"42\"` to the decimal value `42`.\n\n**Example:** arguments by position or by name\n\n```puppet\n$a = Integer.new(\"42\", 8)\n$b = Integer({from => \"42\", radix => 8})\n```\n\nThis would convert the octal (radix 8) number `\"42\"` in string form\nto the decimal value `34`.\n\nThe new function supports two ways of giving the arguments:\n\n* by name (using a hash with property to value mapping)\n* by position (as regular arguments)\n\nNote that it is not possible to create new instances of\nsome abstract data types (for example `Variant`). The data type `Optional[T]` is an\nexception as it will create an instance of `T` or `undef` if the\nvalue to convert is `undef`.\n\nThe arguments that can be given is determined by the data type.\n\n> An assertion is always made that the produced value complies with the given type constraints.\n\n**Example:** data type constraints are checked\n\n```puppet\nInteger[0].new(\"-100\")\n```\n\nWould fail with an assertion error (since value is less than 0).\n\nThe following sections show the arguments and conversion rules\nper data type built into the Puppet Type System.\n\n### Conversion to Optional[T] and NotUndef[T]\n\nConversion to these data types is the same as a conversion to the type argument `T`.\nIn the case of `Optional[T]` it is accepted that the argument to convert may be `undef`.\nIt is however not acceptable to give other arguments (than `undef`) that cannot be\nconverted to `T`.\n\n### Conversion to Integer\n\nA new `Integer` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.\nFor conversion from `String` it is possible to specify the radix (base).\n\n```puppet\ntype Radix = Variant[Default, Integer[2,2], Integer[8,8], Integer[10,10], Integer[16,16]]\n\nfunction Integer.new(\n  String $value,\n  Radix $radix = 10,\n  Boolean $abs = false\n)\n\nfunction Integer.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = false\n)\n```\n\n* When converting from `String` the default radix is 10.\n* If radix is not specified an attempt is made to detect the radix from the start of the string:\n  * `0b` or `0B` is taken as radix 2.\n  * `0x` or `0X` is taken as radix 16.\n  * `0` as radix 8.\n  * All others are decimal.\n* Conversion from `String` accepts an optional sign in the string.\n* For hexadecimal (radix 16) conversion an optional leading \"0x\", or \"0X\" is accepted.\n* For octal (radix 8) an optional leading \"0\" is accepted.\n* For binary (radix 2) an optional leading \"0b\" or \"0B\" is accepted.\n* When `radix` is set to `default`, the conversion is based on the leading.\n  characters in the string. A leading \"0\" for radix 8, a leading \"0x\", or \"0X\" for\n  radix 16, and leading \"0b\" or \"0B\" for binary.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* Conversion from `Integer`, `Float`, and `Boolean` ignores the radix.\n* `Float` value fractions are truncated (no rounding).\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute integer.\n\nExamples - Converting to Integer:\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Integer(\"0xFF\", 16)    # results in 255\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\")         # results in 8\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\", 10)     # results in 10\n$a_number = Integer(true)          # results in 1\n$a_number = Integer(-38, 10, true) # results in 38\n```\n\n### Conversion to Float\n\nA new `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.\nFor conversion from `String` both float and integer formats are supported.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Float.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* For an integer, the floating point fraction of `.0` is added to the value.\n* A `Boolean` `true` is converted to 1.0, and a `false` to 0.0\n* In `String` format, integer prefixes for hex and binary are understood (but not octal since\n  floating point in string format may start with a '0').\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute floating point value.\n\n### Conversion to Numeric\n\nA new `Integer` or `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean` and\n`String` values.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Numeric.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* If the value has a decimal period, or if given in scientific notation\n  (e/E), the result is a `Float`, otherwise the value is an `Integer`. The\n  conversion from `String` always uses a radix based on the prefix of the string.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute `Float`or `Integer` value.\n\nExamples - Converting to Numeric\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Numeric(true)        # results in 1\n$a_number = Numeric(\"0xFF\")      # results in 255\n$a_number = Numeric(\"010\")       # results in 8\n$a_number = Numeric(\"3.14\")      # results in 3.14 (a float)\n$a_number = Numeric(-42.3, true) # results in 42.3\n$a_number = Numeric(-42, true)   # results in 42\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timespan\n\nA new `Timespan` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n#### Timespan from seconds\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n#### Timespan from days, hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second\n\nThe arguments can be passed separately in which case the first four, days, hours, minutes, and seconds are mandatory and the rest are optional.\nAll values may overflow and/or be negative. The internal 128-bit nano-second integer is calculated as:\n\n```\n(((((days * 24 + hours) * 60 + minutes) * 60 + seconds) * 1000 + milliseconds) * 1000 + microseconds) * 1000 + nanoseconds\n```\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Integer $days, Integer $hours, Integer $minutes, Integer $seconds,\n  Integer $milliseconds = 0, Integer $microseconds = 0, Integer $nanoseconds = 0\n)\n```\n\nor, all arguments can be passed as a `Hash`, in which case all entries are optional:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    Optional[negative] => Boolean,\n    Optional[days] => Integer,\n    Optional[hours] => Integer,\n    Optional[minutes] => Integer,\n    Optional[seconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[milliseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[microseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[nanoseconds] => Integer\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\n#### Timespan from String and format directive patterns\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  String $string, Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n\n##### Format directives:\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| D | Number of Days |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..59) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999) |\n| N | Fractional seconds digits |\n\nThe format directive that represents the highest magnitude in the format will be allowed to\noverflow. I.e. if no \"%D\" is used but a \"%H\" is present, then the hours may be more than 23.\n\nThe default array contains the following patterns:\n\n```\n['%D-%H:%M:%S', '%D-%H:%M', '%H:%M:%S', '%H:%M']\n```\n\nExamples - Converting to Timespan\n\n```puppet\n$duration = Timespan(13.5)       # 13 seconds and 500 milliseconds\n$duration = Timespan({days=>4})  # 4 days\n$duration = Timespan(4, 0, 0, 2) # 4 days and 2 seconds\n$duration = Timespan('13:20')    # 13 hours and 20 minutes (using default pattern)\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%L') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 milli-seconds\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%N') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 nano-seconds\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timestamp\n\nA new `Timestamp` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n#### Timestamp from seconds since epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n#### Timestamp from String and patterns consisting of format directives\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nA third optional timezone argument can be provided. The first argument will then be parsed as if it represents a local time in that\ntimezone. The timezone can be any timezone that is recognized when using the '%z' or '%Z' formats, or the word 'current', in which\ncase the current timezone of the evaluating process will be used. The timezone argument is case insensitive.\n\nThe default timezone, when no argument is provided, or when using the keyword `default`, is 'UTC'.\n\nIt is illegal to provide a timezone argument other than `default` in combination with a format that contains '%z' or '%Z' since that\nwould introduce an ambiguity as to which timezone to use. The one extracted from the string, or the one provided as an argument.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  String $string,\n  Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>,\n  String $timezone = default)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]],\n    Optional[timezone] => String[1]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n| #     | Change names to upper-case or change case of am/pm\n| ^     | Use uppercase\n| :     | Use colons for %z\n\n##### Format directives (names and padding can be altered using flags):\n\n**Date (Year, Month, Day):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| Y | Year with century, zero-padded to at least 4 digits |\n| C | year / 100 (rounded down such as 20 in 2009) |\n| y | year % 100 (00..99) |\n| m | Month of the year, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| B | The full month name (\"January\") |\n| b | The abbreviated month name (\"Jan\") |\n| h | Equivalent to %b |\n| d | Day of the month, zero-padded (01..31) |\n| e | Day of the month, blank-padded ( 1..31) |\n| j | Day of the year (001..366) |\n\n**Time (Hour, Minute, Second, Subsecond):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, zero-padded (00..23) |\n| k | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, blank-padded ( 0..23) |\n| I | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| l | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, blank-padded ( 1..12) |\n| P | Meridian indicator, lowercase (\"am\" or \"pm\") |\n| p | Meridian indicator, uppercase (\"AM\" or \"PM\") |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..60) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999).

The defaults for the many options\nhave been chosen with care to be the most basic \"value in textual form\" representation.\nThe more advanced forms of formatting are intended to enable writing special purposes formatting\nfunctions in the Puppet language.\n\nA new string can be created from all other data types. The process is performed in\nseveral steps - first the data type of the given value is inferred, then the resulting data type\nis used to find the most significant format specified for that data type. And finally,\nthe found format is used to convert the given value.\n\nThe mapping from data type to format is referred to as the *format map*. This map\nallows different formatting depending on type.\n\n**Example:** Positive Integers in Hexadecimal prefixed with '0x', negative in Decimal\n\n```puppet\n$format_map = {\n  Integer[default, 0] => \"%d\",\n  Integer[1, default] => \"%#x\"\n}\nString(\"-1\", $format_map)  # produces '-1'\nString(\"10\", $format_map)  # produces '0xa'\n```\n\nA format is specified on the form:\n\n```\n%[Flags][Width][.Precision]Format\n```\n\n`Width` is the number of characters into which the value should be fitted. This allocated space is\npadded if value is shorter. By default it is space padded, and the flag `0` will cause padding with `0`\nfor numerical formats.\n\n`Precision` is the number of fractional digits to show for floating point, and the maximum characters\nincluded in a string format.\n\nNote that all data type supports the formats `s` and `p` with the meaning \"default string representation\" and\n\"default programmatic string representation\" (which for example means that a String is quoted in 'p' format).\n\n#### Signatures of String conversion\n\n```puppet\ntype Format = Pattern[/^%([\\s\\+\\-#0\\[\\{<\\(\\|]*)([1-9][0-9]*)?(?:\\.([0-9]+))?([a-zA-Z])/]\ntype ContainerFormat = Struct[{\n  format         => Optional[String],\n  separator      => Optional[String],\n  separator2     => Optional[String],\n  string_formats => Hash[Type, Format]\n  }]\ntype TypeMap = Hash[Type, Variant[Format, ContainerFormat]]\ntype Formats = Variant[Default, String[1], TypeMap]\n\nfunction String.new(\n  Any $value,\n  Formats $string_formats\n)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `separator` is the string used to separate entries in an array, or hash (extra space should not be included at\n  the end), defaults to `\",\"`\n* `separator2` is the separator between key and value in a hash entry (space padding should be included as\n  wanted), defaults to `\" => \"`.\n* `string_formats` is a data type to format map for values contained in arrays and hashes - defaults to `{Any => \"%p\"}`. Note that\n  these nested formats are not applicable to data types that are containers; they are always formatted as per the top level\n  format specification.\n\n**Example:** Simple Conversion to String (using defaults)\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10)      # produces '10'\n$str = String([10])    # produces '[\"10\"]'\n```\n\n**Example:** Simple Conversion to String specifying the format for the given value directly\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10, \"%#x\")    # produces '0x10'\n$str = String([10], \"%(a\")  # produces '(\"10\")'\n```\n\n**Example:** Specifying type for values contained in an array\n\n```puppet\n$formats = {\n  Array => {\n    format => '%(a',\n    string_formats => { Integer => '%#x' }\n  }\n}\n$str = String([1,2,3], $formats) # produces '(0x1, 0x2, 0x3)'\n```\n\nThe given formats are merged with the default formats, and matching of values to convert against format is based on\nthe specificity of the mapped type; for example, different formats can be used for short and long arrays.\n\n#### Integer to String\n\n| Format  | Integer Formats\n| ------  | ---------------\n| d       | Decimal, negative values produces leading '-'.\n| x X     | Hexadecimal in lower or upper case. Uses ..f/..F for negative values unless + is also used. A `#` adds prefix 0x/0X.\n| o       | Octal. Uses ..0 for negative values unless `+` is also used. A `#` adds prefix 0.\n| b B     | Binary with prefix 'b' or 'B'.

If width is also set\nit is taken as the maximum allowed length of a sequence of elements (not including delimiters). If this max length\nis exceeded, each element will be indented.\n\n#### Hash & Struct to String\n\n| Format    | Hash/Struct Formats\n| ------    | -------------\n| h         | Formats with `{ }` delimiters, `,` element separator and ` => ` inner element separator unless overridden by flags.\n| s         | Same as h.\n| p         | Same as h.\n| a         | Converts the hash to an array of [k,v] tuples and formats it using array rule(s).\n\nSee \"Flags\" `<[({\\|` for formatting of delimiters, and \"Additional parameters for containers; Array and Hash\" for\nmore information about options.\n\nThe alternate form flag `#` will format each hash key/value entry indented on a separate line.\n\n#### Type to String\n\n| Format    | Array/Tuple Formats\n| ------    | -------------\n| s         | The same as `p`, quoted if alternative flag `#` is used.\n| p         | Outputs the type in string form as specified by the Puppet Language.\n\n#### Flags\n\n| Flag     | Effect\n| ------   | ------\n| (space)  | A space instead of `+` for numeric output (`-` is shown), for containers skips delimiters.\n| #        | Alternate format; prefix 0x/0x, 0 (octal) and 0b/0B for binary, Floats force decimal '.'.

an array of tuples on the form `[path, value]`\n(where the `path` is the path from the root of a tree, and `value` the value at that position in the tree), and\neither the option `'tree'` (do not convert arrays to hashes except the top level), or\n`'hash_tree'` (convert all arrays to hashes).\n\nThe tree/hash_tree forms of Hash creation are suited for transforming the result of an iteration\nusing `tree_each` and subsequent filtering or mapping.\n\n**Example:** Mapping a hash tree\n\nMapping an arbitrary structure in a way that keeps the structure, but where some values are replaced\ncan be done by using the `tree_each` function, mapping, and then constructing a new Hash from the result:\n\n```puppet\n# A hash tree with 'water' at different locations\n$h = { a => { b => { x => 'water'}}, b => { y => 'water'} }\n# a helper function that turns water into wine\nfunction make_wine($x) { if $x == 'water' { 'wine' } else { $x } }\n# create a flattened tree with water turned into wine\n$flat_tree = $h.tree_each.map |$entry| { [$entry[0], make_wine($entry[1])] }\n# create a new Hash and log it\nnotice Hash($flat_tree, 'hash_tree')\n```\n\nWould notice the hash `{a => {b => {x => wine}}, b => {y => wine}}`\n\nConversion to a `Struct` works exactly as conversion to a `Hash`, only that the constructed hash is\nasserted against the given struct type.\n\n### Conversion to a Regexp\n\nA `String` can be converted into a `Regexp`\n\n**Example**: Converting a String into a Regexp\n```puppet\n$s = '[a-z]+\\.com'\n$r = Regexp($s)\nif('foo.com' =~ $r) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVer\n\nA SemVer object represents a single [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/).\nIt can be created from a String, individual values for its parts, or a hash specifying the value per part.\nSee the specification at [semver.org](http://semver.org/) for the meaning of the SemVer's parts.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype PositiveInteger = Integer[0,default]\ntype SemVerQualifier = Pattern[/\\A(?<part>[0-9A-Za-z-]+)(?:\\.\\g<part>)*\\Z/]\ntype SemVerString = String[1]\ntype SemVerHash =Struct[{\n  major                => PositiveInteger,\n  minor                => PositiveInteger,\n  patch                => PositiveInteger,\n  Optional[prerelease] => SemVerQualifier,\n  Optional[build]      => SemVerQualifier\n}]\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerString $str)\n\nfunction SemVer.new(\n        PositiveInteger           $major\n        PositiveInteger           $minor\n        PositiveInteger           $patch\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $prerelease = undef\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $build = undef\n        )\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerHash $hash_args)\n```\n\n**Examples:** SemVer and SemVerRange usage\n\n```puppet\n# As a type, SemVer can describe disjunct ranges which versions can be\n# matched against - here the type is constructed with two\n# SemVerRange objects.\n#\n$t = SemVer[\n  SemVerRange('>=1.0.0 <2.0.0'),\n  SemVerRange('>=3.0.0 <4.0.0')\n]\nnotice(SemVer('1.2.3') =~ $t) # true\nnotice(SemVer('2.3.4') =~ $t) # false\nnotice(SemVer('3.4.5') =~ $t) # true\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVerRange\n\nA `SemVerRange` object represents a range of `SemVer`. It can be created from\na `String`, or from two `SemVer` instances, where either end can be given as\na literal `default` to indicate infinity. The string format of a `SemVerRange` is specified by\nthe [Semantic Version Range Grammar](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges).\n\n> Use of the comparator sets described in the grammar (joining with `||`) is not supported.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype SemVerRangeString = String[1]\ntype SemVerRangeHash = Struct[{\n  min                   => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[max]         => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[exclude_max] => Boolean\n}]\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeString $semver_range_string\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $min\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $max\n  Optional[Boolean]       $exclude_max = undef\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeHash $semver_range_hash\n)\n```\n\nFor examples of `SemVerRange` use, see \"Creating a SemVer\".\n\n### Creating a Binary\n\nA `Binary` object represents a sequence of bytes and it can be created from a String in Base64 format,\nan Array containing byte values. A Binary can also be created from a Hash containing the value to convert to\na `Binary`.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype ByteInteger = Integer[0,255]\ntype Base64Format = Enum[\"%b\", \"%u\", \"%B\", \"%s\"]\ntype StringHash = Struct[{value => String, \"format\" => Optional[Base64Format]}]\ntype ArrayHash = Struct[{value => Array[ByteInteger]}]\ntype BinaryArgsHash = Variant[StringHash, ArrayHash]\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  String $base64_str,\n  Optional[Base64Format] $format\n)\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  Array[ByteInteger] $byte_array\n}\n\n# Same as for String, or for Array, but where arguments are given in a Hash.\nfunction Binary.new(BinaryArgsHash $hash_args)\n```\n\nThe formats have the following meaning:\n\n| format | explanation |\n| ----   | ----        |\n| B | The data is in base64 strict encoding\n| u | The data is in URL safe base64 encoding\n| b | The data is in base64 encoding, padding as required by base64 strict, is added by default\n| s | The data is a puppet string. The string must be valid UTF-8, or convertible to UTF-8 or an error is raised.\n| r | (Ruby Raw) the byte sequence in the given string is used verbatim irrespective of possible encoding errors\n\n* The default format is `%B`.\n* Note that the format `%r` should be used sparingly, or not at all. It exists for backwards compatibility reasons when someone receiving\n  a string from some function and that string should be treated as Binary. Such code should be changed to return a Binary instead of a String.\n\n**Examples:** Creating a Binary\n\n```puppet\n# create the binary content \"abc\"\n$a = Binary('YWJj')\n\n# create the binary content from content in a module's file\n$b = binary_file('mymodule/mypicture.jpg')\n```\n\n* Since 4.5.0\n* Binary type since 4.8.0\n\nCreating an instance of a `Type` using the `Init` type.\n-------\n\nThe type `Init[T]` describes a value that can be used when instantiating a type. When used as the first argument in a call to `new`, it\nwill dispatch the call to its contained type and optionally augment the parameter list with additional arguments.\n\n**Example:** Creating an instance of Integer using Init[Integer]\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer].new('128')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer.new('128')\n```\n\nor, with base 16 and using implicit new\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer,16]('80')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer('80', 16)\n```\n\n**Example:** Creating an instance of String using a predefined format\n\n```puppet\n$fmt = Init[String,'%#x']\nnotice($fmt(256)) # will notice '0x100'\n```\n\nDOC\n) do |args|\n  Puppet::Parser::Functions::Error.is4x('new')\nend"

A leading \"0\" for radix 8, a leading \"0x\", or \"0X\" for\n  radix 16, and leading \"0b\" or \"0B\" for binary.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* Conversion from `Integer`, `Float`, and `Boolean` ignores the radix.\n* `Float` value fractions are truncated (no rounding).\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute integer.\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Integer(\"0xFF\", 16)    # results in 255\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\")         # results in 8\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\", 10)     # results in 10\n$a_number = Integer(true)          # results in 1\n$a_number = Integer(-38, 10, true) # results in 38\n```\n\n### Conversion to Float\n\nA new `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.\nFor conversion from `String` both float and integer formats are supported.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Float.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* For an integer, the floating point fraction of `.0` is added to the value.\n* A `Boolean` `true` is converted to 1.0, and a `false` to 0.0\n* In `String` format, integer prefixes for hex and binary are understood (but not octal since\n  floating point in string format may start with a '0').\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute floating point value.\n\n### Conversion to Numeric\n\nA new `Integer` or `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean` and\n`String` values.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Numeric.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* If the value has a decimal period, or if given in scientific notation\n  (e/E), the result is a `Float`, otherwise the value is an `Integer`. The\n  conversion from `String` always uses a radix based on the prefix of the string.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute `Float`or `Integer` value.\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Numeric(true)        # results in 1\n$a_number = Numeric(\"0xFF\")      # results in 255\n$a_number = Numeric(\"010\")       # results in 8\n$a_number = Numeric(\"3.14\")      # results in 3.14 (a float)\n$a_number = Numeric(-42.3, true) # results in 42.3\n$a_number = Numeric(-42, true)   # results in 42\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timespan\n\nA new `Timespan` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n**Timespan from seconds**\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n**Timespan from days, hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second**\n\nThe arguments can be passed separately in which case the first four, days, hours, minutes, and seconds are mandatory and the rest are optional.\nAll values may overflow and/or be negative. The internal 128-bit nano-second integer is calculated as:\n\n```\n(((((days * 24 + hours) * 60 + minutes) * 60 + seconds) * 1000 + milliseconds) * 1000 + microseconds) * 1000 + nanoseconds\n```\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Integer $days, Integer $hours, Integer $minutes, Integer $seconds,\n  Integer $milliseconds = 0, Integer $microseconds = 0, Integer $nanoseconds = 0\n)\n```\n\nor, all arguments can be passed as a `Hash`, in which case all entries are optional:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    Optional[negative] => Boolean,\n    Optional[days] => Integer,\n    Optional[hours] => Integer,\n    Optional[minutes] => Integer,\n    Optional[seconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[milliseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[microseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[nanoseconds] => Integer\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\n**Timespan from String and format directive patterns**\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  String $string, Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n\n##### Format directives:\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| D | Number of Days |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..59) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999) |\n| N | Fractional seconds digits |\n\nThe format directive that represents the highest magnitude in the format will be allowed to\noverflow. I.e. if no \"%D\" is used but a \"%H\" is present, then the hours may be more than 23.\n\nThe default array contains the following patterns:\n\n```\n['%D-%H:%M:%S', '%D-%H:%M', '%H:%M:%S', '%H:%M']\n```\n\nExamples - Converting to Timespan\n\n```puppet\n$duration = Timespan(13.5)       # 13 seconds and 500 milliseconds\n$duration = Timespan({days=>4})  # 4 days\n$duration = Timespan(4, 0, 0, 2) # 4 days and 2 seconds\n$duration = Timespan('13:20')    # 13 hours and 20 minutes (using default pattern)\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%L') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 milli-seconds\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%N') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 nano-seconds\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timestamp\n\nA new `Timestamp` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n**Timestamp from seconds since epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)**\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n**Timestamp from String and patterns consisting of format directives**\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nA third optional timezone argument can be provided. The first argument will then be parsed as if it represents a local time in that\ntimezone. The timezone can be any timezone that is recognized when using the '%z' or '%Z' formats, or the word 'current', in which\ncase the current timezone of the evaluating process will be used. The timezone argument is case insensitive.\n\nThe default timezone, when no argument is provided, or when using the keyword `default`, is 'UTC'.\n\nIt is illegal to provide a timezone argument other than `default` in combination with a format that contains '%z' or '%Z' since that\nwould introduce an ambiguity as to which timezone to use. The one extracted from the string, or the one provided as an argument.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  String $string,\n  Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>,\n  String $timezone = default)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]],\n    Optional[timezone] => String[1]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n| #     | Change names to upper-case or change case of am/pm\n| ^     | Use uppercase\n| :     | Use colons for %z\n\n##### Format directives (names and padding can be altered using flags):\n\n**Date (Year, Month, Day):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| Y | Year with century, zero-padded to at least 4 digits |\n| C | year / 100 (rounded down such as 20 in 2009) |\n| y | year % 100 (00..99) |\n| m | Month of the year, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| B | The full month name (\"January\") |\n| b | The abbreviated month name (\"Jan\") |\n| h | Equivalent to %b |\n| d | Day of the month, zero-padded (01..31) |\n| e | Day of the month, blank-padded ( 1..31) |\n| j | Day of the year (001..366) |\n\n**Time (Hour, Minute, Second, Subsecond):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, zero-padded (00..23) |\n| k | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, blank-padded ( 0..23) |\n| I | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| l | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, blank-padded ( 1..12) |\n| P | Meridian indicator, lowercase (\"am\" or \"pm\") |\n| p | Meridian indicator, uppercase (\"AM\" or \"PM\") |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..60) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999).

The defaults for the many options\nhave been chosen with care to be the most basic \"value in textual form\" representation.\nThe more advanced forms of formatting are intended to enable writing special purposes formatting\nfunctions in the Puppet language.\n\nA new string can be created from all other data types. The process is performed in\nseveral steps - first the data type of the given value is inferred, then the resulting data type\nis used to find the most significant format specified for that data type. And finally,\nthe found format is used to convert the given value.\n\nThe mapping from data type to format is referred to as the *format map*. This map\nallows different formatting depending on type.\n\n```puppet\n$format_map = {\n  Integer[default, 0] => \"%d\",\n  Integer[1, default] => \"%#x\"\n}\nString(\"-1\", $format_map)  # produces '-1'\nString(\"10\", $format_map)  # produces '0xa'\n```\n\nA format is specified on the form:\n\n```\n%[Flags][Width][.Precision]Format\n```\n\n`Width` is the number of characters into which the value should be fitted. This allocated space is\npadded if value is shorter. By default it is space padded, and the flag `0` will cause padding with `0`\nfor numerical formats.\n\n`Precision` is the number of fractional digits to show for floating point, and the maximum characters\nincluded in a string format.\n\nNote that all data type supports the formats `s` and `p` with the meaning \"default string representation\" and\n\"default programmatic string representation\" (which for example means that a String is quoted in 'p' format).\n\n**Signatures of String conversion**\n\n```puppet\ntype Format = Pattern[/^%([\\s\\+\\-#0\\[\\{<\\(\\|]*)([1-9][0-9]*)?(?:\\.([0-9]+))?([a-zA-Z])/]\ntype ContainerFormat = Struct[{\n  format         => Optional[String],\n  separator      => Optional[String],\n  separator2     => Optional[String],\n  string_formats => Hash[Type, Format]\n  }]\ntype TypeMap = Hash[Type, Variant[Format, ContainerFormat]]\ntype Formats = Variant[Default, String[1], TypeMap]\n\nfunction String.new(\n  Any $value,\n  Formats $string_formats\n)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `separator` is the string used to separate entries in an array, or hash (extra space should not be included at\n  the end), defaults to `\",\"`\n* `separator2` is the separator between key and value in a hash entry (space padding should be included as\n  wanted), defaults to `\" => \"`.\n* `string_formats` is a data type to format map for values contained in arrays and hashes - defaults to `{Any => \"%p\"}`. Note that\n  these nested formats are not applicable to data types that are containers; they are always formatted as per the top level\n  format specification.\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10)      # produces '10'\n$str = String([10])    # produces '[\"10\"]'\n```\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10, \"%#x\")    # produces '0x10'\n$str = String([10], \"%(a\")  # produces '(\"10\")'\n```\n\n```puppet\n$formats = {\n  Array => {\n    format => '%(a',\n    string_formats => { Integer => '%#x' }\n  }\n}\n$str = String([1,2,3], $formats) # produces '(0x1, 0x2, 0x3)'\n```\n\nThe given formats are merged with the default formats, and matching of values to convert against format is based on\nthe specificity of the mapped type; for example, different formats can be used for short and long arrays.\n\n**Integer to String**\n\n| Format  | Integer Formats\n| ------  | ---------------\n| d       | Decimal, negative values produces leading '-'.\n| x X     | Hexadecimal in lower or upper case.

an array of tuples on the form `[path, value]`\n(where the `path` is the path from the root of a tree, and `value` the value at that position in the tree), and\neither the option `'tree'` (do not convert arrays to hashes except the top level), or\n`'hash_tree'` (convert all arrays to hashes).\n\nThe tree/hash_tree forms of Hash creation are suited for transforming the result of an iteration\nusing `tree_each` and subsequent filtering or mapping.\n\nMapping an arbitrary structure in a way that keeps the structure, but where some values are replaced\ncan be done by using the `tree_each` function, mapping, and then constructing a new Hash from the result:\n\n```puppet\n# A hash tree with 'water' at different locations\n$h = { a => { b => { x => 'water'}}, b => { y => 'water'} }\n# a helper function that turns water into wine\nfunction make_wine($x) { if $x == 'water' { 'wine' } else { $x } }\n# create a flattened tree with water turned into wine\n$flat_tree = $h.tree_each.map |$entry| { [$entry[0], make_wine($entry[1])] }\n# create a new Hash and log it\nnotice Hash($flat_tree, 'hash_tree')\n```\n\nWould notice the hash `{a => {b => {x => wine}}, b => {y => wine}}`\n\nConversion to a `Struct` works exactly as conversion to a `Hash`, only that the constructed hash is\nasserted against the given struct type.\n\n### Conversion to a Regexp\n\nA `String` can be converted into a `Regexp`\n\n**Example**: Converting a String into a Regexp\n```puppet\n$s = '[a-z]+\\.com'\n$r = Regexp($s)\nif('foo.com' =~ $r) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVer\n\nA SemVer object represents a single [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/).\nIt can be created from a String, individual values for its parts, or a hash specifying the value per part.\nSee the specification at [semver.org](http://semver.org/) for the meaning of the SemVer's parts.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype PositiveInteger = Integer[0,default]\ntype SemVerQualifier = Pattern[/\\A(?<part>[0-9A-Za-z-]+)(?:\\.\\g<part>)*\\Z/]\ntype SemVerString = String[1]\ntype SemVerHash =Struct[{\n  major                => PositiveInteger,\n  minor                => PositiveInteger,\n  patch                => PositiveInteger,\n  Optional[prerelease] => SemVerQualifier,\n  Optional[build]      => SemVerQualifier\n}]\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerString $str)\n\nfunction SemVer.new(\n        PositiveInteger           $major\n        PositiveInteger           $minor\n        PositiveInteger           $patch\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $prerelease = undef\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $build = undef\n        )\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerHash $hash_args)\n```\n\n```puppet\n# As a type, SemVer can describe disjunct ranges which versions can be\n# matched against - here the type is constructed with two\n# SemVerRange objects.\n#\n$t = SemVer[\n  SemVerRange('>=1.0.0 <2.0.0'),\n  SemVerRange('>=3.0.0 <4.0.0')\n]\nnotice(SemVer('1.2.3') =~ $t) # true\nnotice(SemVer('2.3.4') =~ $t) # false\nnotice(SemVer('3.4.5') =~ $t) # true\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVerRange\n\nA `SemVerRange` object represents a range of `SemVer`. It can be created from\na `String`, or from two `SemVer` instances, where either end can be given as\na literal `default` to indicate infinity. The string format of a `SemVerRange` is specified by\nthe [Semantic Version Range Grammar](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges).\n\n> Use of the comparator sets described in the grammar (joining with `||`) is not supported.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype SemVerRangeString = String[1]\ntype SemVerRangeHash = Struct[{\n  min                   => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[max]         => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[exclude_max] => Boolean\n}]\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeString $semver_range_string\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $min\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $max\n  Optional[Boolean]       $exclude_max = undef\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeHash $semver_range_hash\n)\n```\n\nFor examples of `SemVerRange` use see \"Creating a SemVer\"\n\n### Creating a Binary\n\nA `Binary` object represents a sequence of bytes and it can be created from a String in Base64 format,\nan Array containing byte values. A Binary can also be created from a Hash containing the value to convert to\na `Binary`.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype ByteInteger = Integer[0,255]\ntype Base64Format = Enum[\"%b\", \"%u\", \"%B\", \"%s\"]\ntype StringHash = Struct[{value => String, \"format\" => Optional[Base64Format]}]\ntype ArrayHash = Struct[{value => Array[ByteInteger]}]\ntype BinaryArgsHash = Variant[StringHash, ArrayHash]\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  String $base64_str,\n  Optional[Base64Format] $format\n)\n\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  Array[ByteInteger] $byte_array\n}\n\n# Same as for String, or for Array, but where arguments are given in a Hash.\nfunction Binary.new(BinaryArgsHash $hash_args)\n```\n\nThe formats have the following meaning:\n\n| format | explanation |\n| ----   | ----        |\n| B | The data is in base64 strict encoding\n| u | The data is in URL safe base64 encoding\n| b | The data is in base64 encoding, padding as required by base64 strict, is added by default\n| s | The data is a puppet string. The string must be valid UTF-8, or convertible to UTF-8 or an error is raised.\n| r | (Ruby Raw) the byte sequence in the given string is used verbatim irrespective of possible encoding errors\n\n* The default format is `%B`.\n* Note that the format `%r` should be used sparingly, or not at all. It exists for backwards compatibility reasons when someone receiving\n  a string from some function and that string should be treated as Binary. Such code should be changed to return a Binary instead of a String.\n\n```puppet\n# create the binary content \"abc\"\n$a = Binary('YWJj')\n\n# create the binary content from content in a module's file\n$b = binary_file('mymodule/mypicture.jpg')\n```\n\n* Since 4.5.0\n* Binary type since 4.8.0\n\n### Creating an instance of a `Type` using the `Init` type\n\nThe type `Init[T]` describes a value that can be used when instantiating a type. When used as the first argument in a call to `new`, it\nwill dispatch the call to its contained type and optionally augment the parameter list with additional arguments.\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer].new('128')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer.new('128')\n```\n\nor, with base 16 and using implicit new\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer,16]('80')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer('80', 16)\n```\n\n```puppet\n$fmt = Init[String,'%#x']\nnotice($fmt(256)) # will notice '0x100'\n```",

If a block is given it is called with the\njust created instance as an argument.\n\nCalling this function is equivalent to directly\ncalling the data type:\n\n```puppet\n$a = Integer.new(\"42\")\n$b = Integer(\"42\")\n```\n\nThese would both convert the string `\"42\"` to the decimal value `42`.\n\n```puppet\n$a = Integer.new(\"42\", 8)\n$b = Integer({from => \"42\", radix => 8})\n```\n\nThis would convert the octal (radix 8) number `\"42\"` in string form\nto the decimal value `34`.\n\nThe new function supports two ways of giving the arguments:\n\n* by name (using a hash with property to value mapping)\n* by position (as regular arguments)\n\nNote that it is not possible to create new instances of\nsome abstract data types (for example `Variant`).

A leading \"0\" for radix 8, a leading \"0x\", or \"0X\" for\n  radix 16, and leading \"0b\" or \"0B\" for binary.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* Conversion from `Integer`, `Float`, and `Boolean` ignores the radix.\n* `Float` value fractions are truncated (no rounding).\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute integer.\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Integer(\"0xFF\", 16)    # results in 255\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\")         # results in 8\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\", 10)     # results in 10\n$a_number = Integer(true)          # results in 1\n$a_number = Integer(-38, 10, true) # results in 38\n```\n\n### Conversion to Float\n\nA new `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.\nFor conversion from `String` both float and integer formats are supported.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Float.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* For an integer, the floating point fraction of `.0` is added to the value.\n* A `Boolean` `true` is converted to 1.0, and a `false` to 0.0\n* In `String` format, integer prefixes for hex and binary are understood (but not octal since\n  floating point in string format may start with a '0').\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute floating point value.\n\n### Conversion to Numeric\n\nA new `Integer` or `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean` and\n`String` values.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Numeric.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* If the value has a decimal period, or if given in scientific notation\n  (e/E), the result is a `Float`, otherwise the value is an `Integer`. The\n  conversion from `String` always uses a radix based on the prefix of the string.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute `Float`or `Integer` value.\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Numeric(true)        # results in 1\n$a_number = Numeric(\"0xFF\")      # results in 255\n$a_number = Numeric(\"010\")       # results in 8\n$a_number = Numeric(\"3.14\")      # results in 3.14 (a float)\n$a_number = Numeric(-42.3, true) # results in 42.3\n$a_number = Numeric(-42, true)   # results in 42\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timespan\n\nA new `Timespan` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n**Timespan from seconds**\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n**Timespan from days, hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second**\n\nThe arguments can be passed separately in which case the first four, days, hours, minutes, and seconds are mandatory and the rest are optional.\nAll values may overflow and/or be negative. The internal 128-bit nano-second integer is calculated as:\n\n```\n(((((days * 24 + hours) * 60 + minutes) * 60 + seconds) * 1000 + milliseconds) * 1000 + microseconds) * 1000 + nanoseconds\n```\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Integer $days, Integer $hours, Integer $minutes, Integer $seconds,\n  Integer $milliseconds = 0, Integer $microseconds = 0, Integer $nanoseconds = 0\n)\n```\n\nor, all arguments can be passed as a `Hash`, in which case all entries are optional:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    Optional[negative] => Boolean,\n    Optional[days] => Integer,\n    Optional[hours] => Integer,\n    Optional[minutes] => Integer,\n    Optional[seconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[milliseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[microseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[nanoseconds] => Integer\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\n**Timespan from String and format directive patterns**\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  String $string, Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n\n##### Format directives:\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| D | Number of Days |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..59) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999) |\n| N | Fractional seconds digits |\n\nThe format directive that represents the highest magnitude in the format will be allowed to\noverflow. I.e. if no \"%D\" is used but a \"%H\" is present, then the hours may be more than 23.\n\nThe default array contains the following patterns:\n\n```\n['%D-%H:%M:%S', '%D-%H:%M', '%H:%M:%S', '%H:%M']\n```\n\nExamples - Converting to Timespan\n\n```puppet\n$duration = Timespan(13.5)       # 13 seconds and 500 milliseconds\n$duration = Timespan({days=>4})  # 4 days\n$duration = Timespan(4, 0, 0, 2) # 4 days and 2 seconds\n$duration = Timespan('13:20')    # 13 hours and 20 minutes (using default pattern)\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%L') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 milli-seconds\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%N') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 nano-seconds\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timestamp\n\nA new `Timestamp` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n**Timestamp from seconds since epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)**\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n**Timestamp from String and patterns consisting of format directives**\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nA third optional timezone argument can be provided. The first argument will then be parsed as if it represents a local time in that\ntimezone. The timezone can be any timezone that is recognized when using the '%z' or '%Z' formats, or the word 'current', in which\ncase the current timezone of the evaluating process will be used. The timezone argument is case insensitive.\n\nThe default timezone, when no argument is provided, or when using the keyword `default`, is 'UTC'.\n\nIt is illegal to provide a timezone argument other than `default` in combination with a format that contains '%z' or '%Z' since that\nwould introduce an ambiguity as to which timezone to use. The one extracted from the string, or the one provided as an argument.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  String $string,\n  Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>,\n  String $timezone = default)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]],\n    Optional[timezone] => String[1]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n| #     | Change names to upper-case or change case of am/pm\n| ^     | Use uppercase\n| :     | Use colons for %z\n\n##### Format directives (names and padding can be altered using flags):\n\n**Date (Year, Month, Day):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| Y | Year with century, zero-padded to at least 4 digits |\n| C | year / 100 (rounded down such as 20 in 2009) |\n| y | year % 100 (00..99) |\n| m | Month of the year, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| B | The full month name (\"January\") |\n| b | The abbreviated month name (\"Jan\") |\n| h | Equivalent to %b |\n| d | Day of the month, zero-padded (01..31) |\n| e | Day of the month, blank-padded ( 1..31) |\n| j | Day of the year (001..366) |\n\n**Time (Hour, Minute, Second, Subsecond):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, zero-padded (00..23) |\n| k | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, blank-padded ( 0..23) |\n| I | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| l | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, blank-padded ( 1..12) |\n| P | Meridian indicator, lowercase (\"am\" or \"pm\") |\n| p | Meridian indicator, uppercase (\"AM\" or \"PM\") |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..60) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999).

The defaults for the many options\nhave been chosen with care to be the most basic \"value in textual form\" representation.\nThe more advanced forms of formatting are intended to enable writing special purposes formatting\nfunctions in the Puppet language.\n\nA new string can be created from all other data types. The process is performed in\nseveral steps - first the data type of the given value is inferred, then the resulting data type\nis used to find the most significant format specified for that data type. And finally,\nthe found format is used to convert the given value.\n\nThe mapping from data type to format is referred to as the *format map*. This map\nallows different formatting depending on type.\n\n```puppet\n$format_map = {\n  Integer[default, 0] => \"%d\",\n  Integer[1, default] => \"%#x\"\n}\nString(\"-1\", $format_map)  # produces '-1'\nString(\"10\", $format_map)  # produces '0xa'\n```\n\nA format is specified on the form:\n\n```\n%[Flags][Width][.Precision]Format\n```\n\n`Width` is the number of characters into which the value should be fitted. This allocated space is\npadded if value is shorter. By default it is space padded, and the flag `0` will cause padding with `0`\nfor numerical formats.\n\n`Precision` is the number of fractional digits to show for floating point, and the maximum characters\nincluded in a string format.\n\nNote that all data type supports the formats `s` and `p` with the meaning \"default string representation\" and\n\"default programmatic string representation\" (which for example means that a String is quoted in 'p' format).\n\n**Signatures of String conversion**\n\n```puppet\ntype Format = Pattern[/^%([\\s\\+\\-#0\\[\\{<\\(\\|]*)([1-9][0-9]*)?(?:\\.([0-9]+))?([a-zA-Z])/]\ntype ContainerFormat = Struct[{\n  format         => Optional[String],\n  separator      => Optional[String],\n  separator2     => Optional[String],\n  string_formats => Hash[Type, Format]\n  }]\ntype TypeMap = Hash[Type, Variant[Format, ContainerFormat]]\ntype Formats = Variant[Default, String[1], TypeMap]\n\nfunction String.new(\n  Any $value,\n  Formats $string_formats\n)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `separator` is the string used to separate entries in an array, or hash (extra space should not be included at\n  the end), defaults to `\",\"`\n* `separator2` is the separator between key and value in a hash entry (space padding should be included as\n  wanted), defaults to `\" => \"`.\n* `string_formats` is a data type to format map for values contained in arrays and hashes - defaults to `{Any => \"%p\"}`. Note that\n  these nested formats are not applicable to data types that are containers; they are always formatted as per the top level\n  format specification.\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10)      # produces '10'\n$str = String([10])    # produces '[\"10\"]'\n```\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10, \"%#x\")    # produces '0x10'\n$str = String([10], \"%(a\")  # produces '(\"10\")'\n```\n\n```puppet\n$formats = {\n  Array => {\n    format => '%(a',\n    string_formats => { Integer => '%#x' }\n  }\n}\n$str = String([1,2,3], $formats) # produces '(0x1, 0x2, 0x3)'\n```\n\nThe given formats are merged with the default formats, and matching of values to convert against format is based on\nthe specificity of the mapped type; for example, different formats can be used for short and long arrays.\n\n**Integer to String**\n\n| Format  | Integer Formats\n| ------  | ---------------\n| d       | Decimal, negative values produces leading '-'.\n| x X     | Hexadecimal in lower or upper case.

an array of tuples on the form `[path, value]`\n(where the `path` is the path from the root of a tree, and `value` the value at that position in the tree), and\neither the option `'tree'` (do not convert arrays to hashes except the top level), or\n`'hash_tree'` (convert all arrays to hashes).\n\nThe tree/hash_tree forms of Hash creation are suited for transforming the result of an iteration\nusing `tree_each` and subsequent filtering or mapping.\n\nMapping an arbitrary structure in a way that keeps the structure, but where some values are replaced\ncan be done by using the `tree_each` function, mapping, and then constructing a new Hash from the result:\n\n```puppet\n# A hash tree with 'water' at different locations\n$h = { a => { b => { x => 'water'}}, b => { y => 'water'} }\n# a helper function that turns water into wine\nfunction make_wine($x) { if $x == 'water' { 'wine' } else { $x } }\n# create a flattened tree with water turned into wine\n$flat_tree = $h.tree_each.map |$entry| { [$entry[0], make_wine($entry[1])] }\n# create a new Hash and log it\nnotice Hash($flat_tree, 'hash_tree')\n```\n\nWould notice the hash `{a => {b => {x => wine}}, b => {y => wine}}`\n\nConversion to a `Struct` works exactly as conversion to a `Hash`, only that the constructed hash is\nasserted against the given struct type.\n\n### Conversion to a Regexp\n\nA `String` can be converted into a `Regexp`\n\n**Example**: Converting a String into a Regexp\n```puppet\n$s = '[a-z]+\\.com'\n$r = Regexp($s)\nif('foo.com' =~ $r) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVer\n\nA SemVer object represents a single [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/).\nIt can be created from a String, individual values for its parts, or a hash specifying the value per part.\nSee the specification at [semver.org](http://semver.org/) for the meaning of the SemVer's parts.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype PositiveInteger = Integer[0,default]\ntype SemVerQualifier = Pattern[/\\A(?<part>[0-9A-Za-z-]+)(?:\\.\\g<part>)*\\Z/]\ntype SemVerString = String[1]\ntype SemVerHash =Struct[{\n  major                => PositiveInteger,\n  minor                => PositiveInteger,\n  patch                => PositiveInteger,\n  Optional[prerelease] => SemVerQualifier,\n  Optional[build]      => SemVerQualifier\n}]\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerString $str)\n\nfunction SemVer.new(\n        PositiveInteger           $major\n        PositiveInteger           $minor\n        PositiveInteger           $patch\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $prerelease = undef\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $build = undef\n        )\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerHash $hash_args)\n```\n\n```puppet\n# As a type, SemVer can describe disjunct ranges which versions can be\n# matched against - here the type is constructed with two\n# SemVerRange objects.\n#\n$t = SemVer[\n  SemVerRange('>=1.0.0 <2.0.0'),\n  SemVerRange('>=3.0.0 <4.0.0')\n]\nnotice(SemVer('1.2.3') =~ $t) # true\nnotice(SemVer('2.3.4') =~ $t) # false\nnotice(SemVer('3.4.5') =~ $t) # true\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVerRange\n\nA `SemVerRange` object represents a range of `SemVer`. It can be created from\na `String`, or from two `SemVer` instances, where either end can be given as\na literal `default` to indicate infinity. The string format of a `SemVerRange` is specified by\nthe [Semantic Version Range Grammar](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges).\n\n> Use of the comparator sets described in the grammar (joining with `||`) is not supported.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype SemVerRangeString = String[1]\ntype SemVerRangeHash = Struct[{\n  min                   => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[max]         => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[exclude_max] => Boolean\n}]\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeString $semver_range_string\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $min\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $max\n  Optional[Boolean]       $exclude_max = undef\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeHash $semver_range_hash\n)\n```\n\nFor examples of `SemVerRange` use see \"Creating a SemVer\"\n\n### Creating a Binary\n\nA `Binary` object represents a sequence of bytes and it can be created from a String in Base64 format,\nan Array containing byte values. A Binary can also be created from a Hash containing the value to convert to\na `Binary`.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype ByteInteger = Integer[0,255]\ntype Base64Format = Enum[\"%b\", \"%u\", \"%B\", \"%s\"]\ntype StringHash = Struct[{value => String, \"format\" => Optional[Base64Format]}]\ntype ArrayHash = Struct[{value => Array[ByteInteger]}]\ntype BinaryArgsHash = Variant[StringHash, ArrayHash]\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  String $base64_str,\n  Optional[Base64Format] $format\n)\n\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  Array[ByteInteger] $byte_array\n}\n\n# Same as for String, or for Array, but where arguments are given in a Hash.\nfunction Binary.new(BinaryArgsHash $hash_args)\n```\n\nThe formats have the following meaning:\n\n| format | explanation |\n| ----   | ----        |\n| B | The data is in base64 strict encoding\n| u | The data is in URL safe base64 encoding\n| b | The data is in base64 encoding, padding as required by base64 strict, is added by default\n| s | The data is a puppet string. The string must be valid UTF-8, or convertible to UTF-8 or an error is raised.\n| r | (Ruby Raw) the byte sequence in the given string is used verbatim irrespective of possible encoding errors\n\n* The default format is `%B`.\n* Note that the format `%r` should be used sparingly, or not at all. It exists for backwards compatibility reasons when someone receiving\n  a string from some function and that string should be treated as Binary. Such code should be changed to return a Binary instead of a String.\n\n```puppet\n# create the binary content \"abc\"\n$a = Binary('YWJj')\n\n# create the binary content from content in a module's file\n$b = binary_file('mymodule/mypicture.jpg')\n```\n\n* Since 4.5.0\n* Binary type since 4.8.0\n\n### Creating an instance of a `Type` using the `Init` type\n\nThe type `Init[T]` describes a value that can be used when instantiating a type. When used as the first argument in a call to `new`, it\nwill dispatch the call to its contained type and optionally augment the parameter list with additional arguments.\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer].new('128')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer.new('128')\n```\n\nor, with base 16 and using implicit new\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer,16]('80')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer('80', 16)\n```\n\n```puppet\n$fmt = Init[String,'%#x']\nnotice($fmt(256)) # will notice '0x100'\n```",

This\nlets you create a new value or data structure by combining values from the first\nargument's data structure.\n\nThis function takes two mandatory arguments, in this order:\n\n1. An array or hash the function will iterate over.\n2. A lambda, which the function calls for each element in the first argument. It takes\ntwo mandatory parameters:\n    1. A memo value that is overwritten after each iteration with the iteration's result.\n    2. A second value that is overwritten after each iteration with the next value in the\n    function's first argument.\n\n**Example**: Using the `reduce` function\n\n`$data.reduce |$memo, $value| { ... }`\n\nor\n\n`reduce($data) |$memo, $value| { ... }`\n\nYou can also pass an optional \"start memo\" value as an argument, such as `start` below:\n\n`$data.reduce(start) |$memo, $value| { ... }`\n\nor\n\n`reduce($data, start) |$memo, $value| { ... }`\n\nWhen the first argument (`$data` in the above example) is an array, Puppet passes each\nof the data structure's values in turn to the lambda's parameters. When the first\nargument is a hash, Puppet converts each of the hash's values to an array in the form\n`[key, value]`.\n\nIf you pass a start memo value, Puppet executes the lambda with the provided memo value\nand the data structure's first value.

An `Iterable` that the function will iterate over.\n2. An optional lambda, which the function calls for each element in the first argument. It must\n   request one parameter.\n\n**Example:** Using the `reverse_each` function\n\n```puppet\n$data.reverse_each |$parameter| { <PUPPET CODE BLOCK> }\n```\n\nor\n\n```puppet\n$reverse_data = $data.reverse_each\n```\n\nor\n\n```puppet\nreverse_each($data) |$parameter| { <PUPPET CODE BLOCK> }\n```\n\nor\n\n```puppet\n$reverse_data = reverse_each($data)\n```\n\nWhen no second argument is present, Puppet returns an `Iterable` that represents the reverse\norder of its first argument. This allows methods on `Iterable` to be chained.\n\nWhen a lambda is given as the second argument, Puppet iterates the first argument in reverse\norder and passes each value in turn to the lambda, then returns `undef`.\n\n**Example:** Using the `reverse_each` function with an array and a one-parameter lambda\n\n``` puppet\n# Puppet will log a notice for each of the three items\n# in $data in reverse order.\n$data = [1,2,3]\n$data.reverse_each |$item| { notice($item) }\n```\n\nWhen no second argument is present, Puppet returns a new `Iterable` which allows it to\nbe directly chained into another function that takes an `Iterable` as an argument.\n\n**Example:** Using the `reverse_each` function chained with a `map` function.\n\n```puppet\n# For the array $data, return an array containing each\n# value multiplied by 10 in reverse order\n$data = [1,2,3]\n$transformed_data = $data.reverse_each.map |$item| { $item * 10 }\n# $transformed_data is set to [30,20,10]\n```\n\n**Example:** Using `reverse_each` function chained with a `map` in alternative syntax\n\n```puppet\n# For the array $data, return an array containing each\n# value multiplied by 10 in reverse order\n$data = [1,2,3]\n$transformed_data = map(reverse_each($data)) |$item| { $item * 10 }\n# $transformed_data is set to [30,20,10]\n```\n\n* Since 4.4.0\n\nDOC\n) do |args|\n  Puppet::Parser::Functions::Error.is4x('reverse_each')\nend"

An 'Iterable' that the function will iterate over.\n2. An `Integer` step factor. This must be a positive integer.\n3. An optional lambda, which the function calls for each element in the interval. It must\n   request one parameter.\n\n**Example:** Using the `step` function\n\n```puppet\n$data.step(<n>) |$parameter| { <PUPPET CODE BLOCK> }\n```\n\nor\n\n```puppet\n$stepped_data = $data.step(<n>)\n```\n\nor\n```puppet\nstep($data, <n>) |$parameter| { <PUPPET CODE BLOCK> }\n```\n\nor\n\n```puppet\n$stepped_data = step($data, <n>)\n```\n\nWhen no block is given, Puppet returns an `Iterable` that yields the first element and every nth successor\nelement, from its first argument. This allows functions on iterables to be chained.\nWhen a block is given, Puppet iterates and calls the block with the first element and then with\nevery nth successor element. It then returns `undef`.\n\n**Example:** Using the `step` function with an array, a step factor, and a one-parameter block\n\n```puppet\n# For the array $data, call a block with the first element and then with each 3rd successor element\n$data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\n$data.step(3) |$item| {\n notice($item)\n}\n# Puppet notices the values '1', '4', '7'.\n```\n\nWhen no block is given, Puppet returns a new `Iterable` which allows it to be directly chained into\nanother function that takes an `Iterable` as an argument.\n\n**Example:** Using the `step` function chained with a `map` function.\n\n```puppet\n# For the array $data, return an array, set to the first element and each 5th successor element, in reverse\n# order multiplied by 10\n$data = Integer[0,20]\n$transformed_data = $data.step(5).map |$item| { $item * 10 }\n$transformed_data contains [0,50,100,150,200]\n```\n\n**Example:** The same example using `step` function chained with a `map` in alternative syntax\n\n```puppet\n# For the array $data, return an array, set to the first and each 5th\n# successor, in reverse order, multiplied by 10\n$data = Integer[0,20]\n$transformed_data = map(step($data, 5)) |$item| { $item * 10 }\n$transformed_data contains [0,50,100,150,200]\n```\n\n* Since 4.4.0",

An `Array`, `Hash`, `Iterator`, or `Object` that the function will iterate over.\n2. An optional hash with the options:\n   * `include_containers` => `Optional[Boolean]` # default true - if containers should be given to the lambda\n   * `include_values` => `Optional[Boolean]` # default true - if non containers should be given to the lambda\n   * `include_root` => `Optional[Boolean]` # default true - if the root container should be given to the lambda\n   * `container_type` => `Optional[Type[Variant[Array, Hash, Object]]]` # a type that determines what a container is - can only\n      be set to a type that matches the default `Variant[Array, Hash, Object]`.\n   * `order` => `Enum[depth_first, breadth_first]` # default ´depth_first`, the order in which elements are visited\n   * `include_refs` => Optional[Boolean] # default `false`, if attributes in objects marked as bing of `reference` kind\n      should be included.\n3. An optional lambda, which the function calls for each element in the first argument. It must\n   accept one or two arguments; either `$path`, and `$value`, or just `$value`.\n\n`$data.tree_each |$path, $value| { <PUPPET CODE BLOCK> }`\n`$data.tree_each |$value| { <PUPPET CODE BLOCK> }`\n\nor\n\n`tree_each($data) |$path, $value| { <PUPPET CODE BLOCK> }`\n`tree_each($data) |$value| { <PUPPET CODE BLOCK> }`\n\nThe parameter `$path` is always given as an `Array` containing the path that when applied to\nthe tree as `$data.dig(*$path) yields the `$value`.\nThe `$value` is the value at that path.\n\nFor `Array` values, the path will contain `Integer` entries with the array index,\nand for `Hash` values, the path will contain the hash key, which may be `Any` value.\nFor `Object` containers, the entry is the name of the attribute (a `String`).\n\nThe tree is walked in either depth-first order, or in breadth-first order under the control of the\n`order` option, yielding each `Array`, `Hash`, `Object`, and each entry/attribute.\nThe default is `depth_first` which means that children are processed before siblings.\nAn order of `breadth_first` means that siblings are processed before children.\n\n```puppet\n[1, [2, 3], 4]\n```\n\nResults in:\n\nIf containers are skipped:\n\n* `depth_first` order `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`\n* `breadth_first` order `1`, `4`,`2`, `3`\n\nIf containers and root, are included:\n\n* `depth_first` order `[1, [2, 3], 4]`, `1`, `[2, 3]`, `2`, `3`, `4`\n* `breadth_first` order `[1, [2, 3], 4]`, `1`, `[2, 3]`, `4`, `2`, `3`\n\nTypical use of the `tree_each` function include:\n* a more efficient way to iterate over a tree than first using `flatten` on an array\n  as that requires a new (potentially very large) array to be created\n* when a tree needs to be transformed and 'pretty printed' in a template\n* avoiding having to write a special recursive function when tree contains hashes (flatten does\n  not work on hashes)\n\n```puppet\n$data = [1, 2, [3, [4, 5]]]\n$data.tree_each({include_containers => false}) |$v| { notice \"$v\" }\n```\n\nThis would call the lambda 5 times with with the following values in sequence: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`\n\n```puppet\n$data = [1, 2, [3, [4, 5]]]\n$data.tree_each |$v| { notice \"$v\" }\n```\n\nThis would call the lambda 7 times with the following values in sequence:\n`1`, `2`, `[3, [4, 5]]`, `3`, `[4, 5]`, `4`, `5`\n\n```puppet\n$data = [1, 2, [3, [4, 5]]]\n$data.tree_each({include_values => false, include_root => false}) |$v| { notice \"$v\" }\n```\n\nThis would call the lambda 2 times with the following values in sequence:\n`[3, [4, 5]]`, `[4, 5]`\n\nAny Puppet Type system data type can be used to filter what is\nconsidered to be a container, but it must be a narrower type than one of\nthe default Array, Hash, Object types - for example it is not possible to make a\n`String` be a container type.\n\n```puppet\n$data = [1, {a => 'hello', b => [100, 200]}, [3, [4, 5]]]\n$data.tree_each({container_type => Array, include_containers => false} |$v| { notice \"$v\" }\n```\n\nWould call the lambda 5 times with `1`, `{a => 'hello', b => [100, 200]}`, `3`, `4`, `5`\n\n**Chaining** When calling `tree_each` without a lambda the function produces an `Iterator`\nthat can be chained into another iteration. Thus it is easy to use one of:\n\n* `reverse_each` - get \"leaves before root\"\n* `filter` - prune the tree\n* `map` - transform each element\n* `reduce` - produce something else\n\nNote than when chaining, the value passed on is a `Tuple` with `[path, value]`.\n\n```puppet\n# A tree of some complexity (here very simple for readability)\n$tree = [\n { name => 'user1', status => 'inactive', id => '10'},\n { name => 'user2', status => 'active', id => '20'}\n]\nnotice $tree.tree_each.filter |$v| {\n $value = $v[1]\n $value =~ Hash and $value[status] == active\n}\n```\n\nWould notice `[[[1], {name => user2, status => active, id => 20}]]`, which can then be processed\nfurther as each filtered result appears as a `Tuple` with `[path, value]`.\n\n\nFor general examples that demonstrates iteration see the Puppet\n[iteration](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_iteration.html)\ndocumentation.",

This\n  enables transformation of the value before comparison. The result of the lambda is only used for comparison.\n* The optional code block when used with a hash is given each value (not the keys).\n\n```puppet\n# will produce 'abc'\n\"abcaabb\".unique\n```\n\n```puppet\n# will produce ['a', 'b', 'c']\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'b'].unique\n```\n\n```puppet\n# will produce { ['a', 'b'] => [10], ['c'] => [20]}\n{'a' => 10, 'b' => 10, 'c' => 20}.unique\n\n# will produce { 'a' => 10, 'c' => 20 } (use first key with first value)\nHash.new({'a' => 10, 'b' => 10, 'c' => 20}.unique.map |$k, $v| { [ $k[0] , $v[0]] })\n\n# will produce { 'b' => 10, 'c' => 20 } (use last key with first value)\nHash.new({'a' => 10, 'b' => 10, 'c' => 20}.unique.map |$k, $v| { [ $k[-1] , $v[0]] })\n```\n\n```\n# will produce [3, 2, 1]\n[1,2,2,3,3].reverse_each.unique\n```\n\n```puppet\n# will produce [['sam', 'smith'], ['sue', 'smith']]\n[['sam', 'smith'], ['sam', 'brown'], ['sue', 'smith']].unique |$x| { $x[0] }\n\n# will produce [['sam', 'smith'], ['sam', 'brown']]\n[['sam', 'smith'], ['sam', 'brown'], ['sue', 'smith']].unique |$x| { $x[1] }\n\n# will produce ['aBc', 'bbb'] (using a lambda to make comparison using downcased (%d) strings)\n['aBc', 'AbC', 'bbb'].unique |$x| { String($x,'%d') }\n\n# will produce {[a] => [10], [b, c, d, e] => [11, 12, 100]}\n{a => 10, b => 11, c => 12, d => 100, e => 11}.unique |$v| { if $v > 10 { big } else { $v } } \n```\n\nNote that for `Hash` the result is slightly different than for the other data types. For those the result contains the\n*first-found* unique value, but for `Hash` it contains associations from a set of keys to the set of values clustered by the\nequality lambda (or the default value equality if no lambda was given). This makes the `unique` function more versatile for hashes\nin general, while requiring that the simple computation of \"hash's unique set of values\" is performed as `$hsh.map |$k, $v| { $v }.unique`.\n(A unique set of hash keys is in general meaningless (since they are unique by definition) - although if processed with a different\nlambda for equality that would be different. First map the hash to an array of its keys if such a unique computation is wanted). \nIf the more advanced clustering is wanted for one of the other data types, simply transform it into a `Hash` as shown in the\nfollowing example.\n\n```puppet\n# Array ['a', 'b', 'c'] to Hash with index results in\n# {0 => 'a', 1 => 'b', 2 => 'c'}\nHash(['a', 'b', 'c'].map |$i, $v| { [$i, $v]})\n\n# String \"abc\" to Hash with index results in\n# {0 => 'a', 1 => 'b', 2 => 'c'}\nHash(Array(\"abc\").map |$i,$v| { [$i, $v]})\n\"abc\".to(Array).map |$i,$v| { [$i, $v]}.to(Hash)\n```",

For example if keys \"aBC\", and \"abC\" where both present, after upcase there would only be one\n  key \"ABC\".\n* If the value is `Numeric` it is simply returned (this is for backwards compatibility).\n* An error is raised for all other data types.\n\nPlease note: This function relies directly on Ruby's String implementation and as such may not be entirely UTF8 compatible.\nTo ensure best compatibility please use this function with Ruby 2.4.0 or greater - https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10085.\n\n```puppet\n'hello'.upcase()\nupcase('hello')\n```\nWould both result in \"HELLO\"\n\n```puppet\n['a', 'b'].upcase()\nupcase(['a', 'b'])\n```\nWould both result in ['A', 'B']\n\n```puppet\n{'a' => 'hello', 'b' => 'goodbye'}.upcase()\n```\nWould result in `{'A' => 'HELLO', 'B' => 'GOODBYE'}`\n\n```puppet\n['a', 'b', ['c', ['d']], {'x' => 'y'}].upcase\n```\nWould result in `['A', 'B', ['C', ['D']], {'X' => 'Y'}]`",
